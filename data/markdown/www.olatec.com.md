Olatec is dedicated to improving the health and physical well-being of patients around the world, through the development and commercialization of our platform of safe and effective pharmaceuticals that treat a broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases.

​Olatec is a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing a platform of safe, oral NLRP3 antagonist therapeutics, to treat and prevent a broad spectrum of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases that are known to be mediated by Interleukin-1 (IL-1), including: arthritis, heart failure, asthma, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, type-2 diabetes, melanoma and breast cancers, among others.

By selectively targeting NLRP3, the body’s first line response in the innate immune system, Olatec’s lead compound, dapansutrile (lab code: OLT1177®) inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL‑1β and IL‑18.

Olatec’s drug development team, working together over 10 years, is comprised of experienced management and international thought leaders that have unparalleled expertise in inflammation and immunology and have been involved in the discovery and development of first-line inflammation treatments in the market today.  The Company conducts operations in the United States and Europe and maintains offices in New York and the Netherlands

| ## **[Our Pipeline](https://www.olatec.com/pipeline.html)**<br>In addition to dapansutrile, Olatec’s platform includes approximately 40 pharmaceutical candidates.  Protecting the Company’s assets is a strong and growing portfolio of intellectual property consisting of over 180 patents and patent applications globally. | ## **[Our Science](https://www.olatec.com/science.html)**<br>Dapansutrile inhibits NLRP3, the sensor molecule integral in the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.  By specific binding to NLRP3, dapansutrile prevents the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn inhibits the production of IL-1β and IL-18. | ## **[Our Team](https://www.olatec.com/scientific-advisory-board.html)**<br>Olatec’s experienced management and drug development team, working together over 10 years, includes international thought leaders or Key Opinion Leaders (KOL), who have previously been involved in the development of first-line treatments in the NSAID and biologic classes of therapies.  These KOLs cover a wide range of disciplines and are uniquely integrated into all aspects of Olatec’s operations. | |  |
