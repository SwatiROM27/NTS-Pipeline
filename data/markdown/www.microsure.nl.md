## Go where no human has gone before

Although supermicrosurgeons are amongst the world’s finest surgeons, they still face human limitations when it comes to performing surgery on the smallest anatomical structures.

Our microsurgical robot enables more surgeons to comfortably perform the most challenging microsurgery. Together, we can realize our dream: to leave no patient in need of microsurgery untreated.

## Learn more about MUSA-3

MUSA-3 is our newest microsurgery robot. The surgeon sits ergonomically at the console to view the screen of the digital or hybrid microscope. The joystick movements are scaled and tremor-filtered to help you improve your precision even further. MUSA’s unique instrument platform allows you to use your own microsurgical instruments with high precision and enhanced dexterity.

MUSA-3 will help high-performing surgeons go beyond their limits, so that no patient is left untreated.

> MUSA allows us to operate on minuscule lymph vessels and blood vessels with more ease, while getting better results for these complex and fatiguing interventions. Besides it is very convenient that, within microsurgery, we can operate on vessels of every size with this robot. Most importantly, of course, this is good news for the patients concerned.
