Speed up your cultivation programme.

An increasing number of breeders and growers is starting to use imaging systems for assessing the quality or current stage of development of their products.

Imaging systems are already being used for a variety of simple tasks, like sorting based on size, height, and width. Multispectral and efficiency of photosynthesis imaging, however, allows you to identify plants that perform poorly in photosynthesis or plant physiological parameters such as the chlorophyll index and anthocyanin index. These new parameters will accelerate breeding projects due to early assessment and more objective measurements.
