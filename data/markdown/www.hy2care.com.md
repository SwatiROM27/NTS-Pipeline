## Hydrogel implant for enabling cartilage recovery

# Hy2Care hydrogel

**The CartRevive** ® **hydrogel implant has been developed for functional recovery of cartilage defects in joints. The hydrogel is based on joint-tissue mimicking natural polymers; it aims to protect the injured site and is intended to facilitate natural repair.**

Millions of people suffer from traumatic cartilage defects following a (sports) accident, slip or fall. They want a fast healing, to get rid of the pain and return to full activity. An optimal repair of these defects is also essential to prevent the onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA), which could cause many years of chronic pain and immobility.

The unique composition of Hy2Care’sCartRevive® hydrogel implant creates a natural scaffold for the patient’s own cells to reside in and deposit new cartilage matrix, enabling the body to heal itself.
