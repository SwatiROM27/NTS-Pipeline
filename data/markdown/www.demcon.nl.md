**A fresh frequency at Demcon**\\
\\
The Demcon group, developer and manufacturer of technology and innovation products, has partially acquired Sound Solutions Holding and incorporated it into Demcon sound solutions. This young company develops innovative acoustic measurement solutions and works on combating noise and harmful vibrations. The acquisition is poised to give a significant boost to Demcon's expertise in acoustics and vibration. "Together, we can tackle even the most challenging problems, such as the major disruptions that vibrations can cause in high-tech systems. Ideally, one would prevent vibrations by design."\\

**Utrecht Spin-off with Bioreactor for Organoid Cultivation Joins Demcon**\\
\\
Boost for Medical, Biotechnological, and Pharmaceutical Research.\\
\\
Technology developer and manufacturer Demcon acquired a majority stake in Orgonex at the end of last year. The spin-off from Utrecht University / the Innovation Center for Advanced Therapies (ICAT) has developed a bioreactor for cultivating organoids. Organoids are miniature organs used for medical, biotechnological, and pharmaceutical research. Orgonex's bioreactor yields five times higher than traditional manual cultivation methods and is more compact and straightforward than other automated cultivation solutions. This system offers an accessible solution for efficiently cultivating sufficient organoids and can be easily integrated into existing laboratory infrastructures at academic research groups and pharmaceutical companies. Together with Demcon, Orgonex is now developing the bioreactor into a professional system that will be launched later this year.\\
