## Innovative scan technology

**With T-Soles, you can seamlessly scan and analyse your patient’s feet while they are standing AND wearing their shoes!**

This innovative approach captures highly detailed information about your patient’s foot problems in a natural, weight-bearing stance. This standing 3D-CT scanner provides insights into the anatomy, biomechanics, and pathology of the feet. For a swift start, leverage the T-Soles pressure plate to gather valuable pressure data, enabling you to craft custom insoles tailored to your patient’s needs.
