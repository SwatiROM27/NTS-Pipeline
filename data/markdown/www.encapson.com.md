## Challenge

Standard medical devices have a poor visibility in ultrasound imaging, creating a risk when carrying out medical interventions

Mediocre needle visibility leads to multiple insertion and repositioning efforts causing patient discomfort and an increased failure rate in vascular access and biopsy procedures

Poor

Visibility

Compromised

Precision

Increased

Risk

## Visibility Solutions

Sono-Coat® is a game-changing technology in situations “when precision counts”. Sono-Coat® catheters and needles are clearly visible in the image, allowing effortless location from any possible angle

The use of Sono-Coat® devices leads to an accurate diagnosis, reduced complication rates and better patient outcomes

## Unmatched visibility

Sono-Coat® provides excellent ultrasound visibility for catheters and needles, supporting clinicians in safely and accurately performing US-guided procedures

In deeper tissue structures the Sono-Coat® technology

enables precise targeting of objects

Patients benefit from safe, quick and first-time-right interventions

## Underlying Technology

The Sono-Coat® technology is based on a coating matrix containing acoustically reflective microspheres. The reflective microspheres scatter the ultrasound waves in all directions

This scattering effect causes more ultrasound signal to be reflected to the probe, no matter the angle, resulting in a clear, sharp image on the screen

## A New Standard

The NICE study published in GIE compares the ultrasound visibility of a Sono-Coat® needle and 8 commonly used echogenic needles. The Sono-Coat® needle outperformed (p<0.01) all other echogenic needles and was ranked number 1 in ultrasound visibility during a blind review by 60 interventional clinicians

## Multiple Applications

The Sono-Coat® technology can be applied to a large variety of medical devices: the P-series coating system specifically developed for Polyurethane, Nylon, PEBAX, PEEK, PVC, and Polysilicon devices and the M-Series for Steel, Titanium, Nitinol and Ceramic based devices

Sono-Coat® is biocompatible, temperature resistant, and can be overcoated with lubricious, anti-microbial and anti-thrombogenic coatings without loss of echogenicity
