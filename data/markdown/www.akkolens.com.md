# The Lumina can restore your full range of vision

## Restoring vision without the use of spectacles

AkkoLens has developed the _Lumina_ lens, an accommodative intraocular lens (AIOL) that can restore vision and accommodation. The _Lumina_ allows you to see sharp images at all distances without the use of spectacles.

## Cataract and presbyopia

- Your eyesight becomes compromised when you grow older. In your 40â€™s, your eyes lose the ability to accommodate, to focus on nearby objects. You have become a presbyope and need spectacles for reading. Cataract, a cloudiness of the natural lens, generally develops from the age of 60 onwards.
- Cataract can be treated by exchange of the cloudy natural lens by a clear artificial lens during a short and routine surgery.
- Monofocal artificial lenses are used most for such exchange. Monofocal lenses only offer sharp vision at only one distance because they cannot change their shape as the young natural lens can. So, you will need spectacles for intermediate vision, as in computer tasks, and for near vision, as in reading.
- The _Lumina_ is especially designed to change focus, change optical power, and can provide intermediate and near vision as well as sharp distance vison.

## The lens will be available at a number of selected European eye clinics; a list of these will be published soon on this website.
