## No installation. No queues. Unlock the full potential of cryo-EM.

Cryo-EM is a Nobel Prize winning method that is revolutionizing biology by providing insights into the 3D architecture of proteins. Better access to cryo-EM infrastructure, faster detectors and improved acquisition schemes have accelerated data aquisition & made cryo-EM more accessible – but at the same time increased the burden on data analysis. Queues, insufficient disk space or even downtime due to failing components can be the consequence, hindering timely results.

CryoCloud is here to address those issues. CryoCloud's web-app provides instant access to cloud resources, image analysis workflows & storage solutions for cryo-EM data analysis. It eliminates queues, downtimes, the need for setup costs & hardware maintenance, while providing optimized & accelerated computation via an intuitive UI. Get started with your data analysis right away: we take care of the setup, so you can focus on your research.

## Get started right away

CryoCloud aims to simplify all steps from data to structure, and remove all bottlenecks of data analysis by moving it to the cloud. This removes entry barriers for new researchers and faciliates analysis for everybody. No installation or setup is needed. Just create an account and get started on your data analysis - it’s that simple.
