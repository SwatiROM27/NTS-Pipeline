## Solutions for _in vivo_ electrophysiology

##### In systems neuroscience, researchers often push the limits of experimental methods and equipment. We're here to help!

With a focus on **brain implants in animal models**, we help researchers who want to record neural activity to realize their new ideas faster and easier. To do that, we push the limits of 3D printing and machining to produce designs that combine performance, handling ease and user priorities such as enabling electrode reuse.

We also collaborate on multiple custom R&D projects, from rodent head fixation in VR setups and MRI scanners to various treadmill designs.

In line with our [mission](https://shop.3dneuro.com/mission/), we actively contribute to the [open source/open hardware](https://www.3dneuro.com/open-hardware/) space.

See our X account [@3Dneuro](https://twitter.com/3Dneuro) for company news and views.

We specialize in making custom implants for _in vivo_ (rodent) electrophysiology, to help researchers use cutting-edge high-density silicon probes, by themselves or together with other recording and stimulation tools.
