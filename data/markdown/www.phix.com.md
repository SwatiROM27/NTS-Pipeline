HOW WE PHIX IT

To integrate PICs into devices, they need to be connected to components like optical fibers, (RF) electronics, and bulk optics with great accuracy. This packaging of our customers’ PICs, either as an outsourced packaging service or as contract manufacturer, is PHIX’s world leading core competence.

- We scale up with your product roadmap, from prototypes to medium and large series
- We support and combine many material platforms, such as silicon photonics, indium phosphide, silicon nitride, lithium niobate, gallium arsenide and ion exchanged glass
- We are your one-stop-shop, by helping you to optimally lay out your PIC with manufacturability and scale-up in mind
- We have a unique process for multi-chip hybrid integration using edge coupling
- We are European based and protect your intellectual property
- We have [partnerships](https://www.phix.com/partnerships/) with key players in the photonics industry
- We have [fiber arrays](https://www.phix.com/fiber_arrays/) available for shipment directly from stock

### PIC Design

Optimizing a PIC based device for performance, robustness, cost-effectiveness, and time to market already begins at the layouting stage of the PIC design. Therefore, to help PIC designers achieve a layout that is set up for packaging success, PHIX is offering a document called “Design Guidelines for Photonic Integrated Circuit Packaging” for free download.

[Download PIC Design Guidelines](https://www.phix.com/pic-design-guidelines/)

### PIC Packaging

Photonic chips need to be interfaced with other components, such as [fiber arrays](https://www.phix.com/fiber_arrays/), free space and electronics, before they can find their way into your product. If your PIC-based module is in the prototype phase, our [Prototype Packages](https://www.phix.com/our-offering/prototype-package) are an easy and affordable way to test your technology quickly. When your chip is ready for volume production, we provide [Volume Packaging](https://www.phix.com/our-offering/volume-package/) services, using our wide experience in various markets.
