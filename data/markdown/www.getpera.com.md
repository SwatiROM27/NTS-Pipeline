## We don't like **guesswork**

Although personality, cognitive and gamified assessments are unbiased, they do not directly predict performance. That is why we use actual performance data to compare a candidate's answers with those of 5 million professionals in our database.

Step 1

## Candidates answer **3 questions**

No more difficult, time-consuming or stressful assessments. Candidates simply answer 3 of our validated questions in an intuitive environment, completely in your house style. A better experience for them, less drop-off for you.

![AS_Seedlink_20220815_0110](https://media.getperacdn.com/media/images/AS_Seedlink_20220815_0110.original.jpg)

Step 2

## Pera predicts their **job-performance & culture-fit**

To predict performance, you need to use actual performance data. We do this based on 5 million professionals in our database.

This way, our AI can predict the job-performance & culture-fit of candidates in certain positions, departments or organisations.

Step 3

## **You simply interview** the candidates

Forget hours of scrolling through CVs, or inviting and interviewing candidates on gut feeling. Pera scores all candidates, ranks them based on expected performance and provides an in-depth report including ready-made follow-up questions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## What makes Pera different from other assessments?

We directly measure the competencies we know lead to success. Our AI uses language data to benchmark candidates against millions of professionals in our database on the competencies that our data shows lead to success. This approach is unique and only possible with AI, and leads to better predictions than anything on the market today. Because of our approach, the interview only requires 15 minutes from candidates. Additionally, we do not use self-assessments, which is common in personality based competitors.

## How do you know Pera works?

Besides having shown strong statistical correlations in our 7+ years of work ( [see the science behind Pera](https://www.getpera.com/en/product/science-behind/)), we have been able to strongly impact the partners we have worked with. High scorers on our ‘Commercial Success’ benchmark generate 194% of their peers revenue within the first two years of working, while other Pera top scorers are 2.8x more likely to be marked as top performers compared to their peers.

## Are three questions really enough to assess talent?

Yes. This is due to two main things: 1) the method and 2) the depth of data. Based on 7 years research and development we found the optimal balance between candidate experience and accurate outcomes. The [Pera Skope](https://www.getpera.com/en/product/) assesses ‘how’ someone writes and looks at over 200 markers in the responses, connecting this to intelligence about successful professionals. Intelligence gained from researching millions of people identifying the competencies that have proven to deliver success in jobs.

## Is Pera Digital Interview unbiased?

Yes, Pera ensures fairness by eliminating discriminatory information and providing equal opportunities to all candidates. The platform is unbiased by design.

## How does Pera ensure the security of candidate data?

Pera prioritizes top-notch security for candidate data, ensuring integrity, confidentiality, and reliable assessment results. We are ISO 27001 certified and GDPR compliant. [See our security pages](https://www.getpera.com/en/security/).
