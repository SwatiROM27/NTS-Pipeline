# About Aglaia

Aglaia invests in oncology drug development companies. Aglaia has a proven ability to select and mature early-stage breakthrough inventions that have the potential to transform cancer treatment.

## Decades of experience

The Aglaia team has decades of experience in cancer research and oncology drug development. Since 2004, Aglaia has built an excellent reputation in starting up biotech companies that focus on oncology drug development.

Aglaia is committed to define the strategic directions of the companies it invests in in close collaboration with innovators and entrepreneurs. Aglaia brings hands-on experience in designing research and development plans, ranging from early screening and animal feasibility studies through clinical studies.

## Aglaia Oncology Funds

- Aglaia Oncology Fund I: dissolved
- Aglaia Oncology Fund II: active
- Aglaia Oncology Growth Opportunity Fund: active
- Aglaia Oncology Growth Opportunity Fund II: active
- Aglaia Oncology Fund III: planned

Through its Oncology Funds I and II, Aglaia has invested in 12 early stage companies, of which 6 were founded by Aglaia. Aglaia Growth Fund(s) further invest in selected portfolio companies. The experienced team has been involved in the development of more than 100 oncology products. The continuous strategic and operational involvement of the team with portfolio companies has contributed to a marked success rate in transitioning early-stage portfolio companies to clinical-stage companies. By doing so, Aglaia has de-risked and matured these companies up to the level at which they become attractive candidates for licensing, acquisition or IPO.

## Goddess Aglaia

Aglaia was the Greek goddess of beauty and good health. Together with her two sisters (Thalia and Euphrosyne), she was one of the three graces. The three graces were regarded as the inspirers of culture, love and wisdom. Or, more in general, bringing the feeling of wellbeing to the people. In line with the three graces, it is the intention of Aglaia Oncology Funds to contribute to the good health and the wellbeing of people by developing innovative therapies for cancer with higher cure rates and less side effects.

| ![](https://aglaia-oncology.com/media/uploads/image/20180912-IMG_0701.jpg) |  | _Aglaia is currently not reviewing new investment opportunities._<br>_A_ glaia is looking for excellent cancer research with the potential to be translated into cancer medicines. This translates specifically in:<br>- Early-stage oncology drug development<br>- Disruptive science with the potential to transform cancer diagnosis and therapy<br>- Spread across different drug modalities (small molecules, biologicals, etc.) and drug development phases (from target discovery up to clinical development)<br>Inventions should have a potential to be superior to standard of care treatment at time of market introduction and should lead to clear benefits for cancer patients and society.  Inventions should be preferably platform technologies but highly interesting drug candidates with first in class potential are also considered. Drug candidates must be rigorously validated in relevant and predictive preclinical cancer models. Evidence must be provided that inventions can be patented. |

# Impact

Aglaia’s team and their limited partners are committed in achieving a positive impact on patents and society in addition to achieving a compelling financial return. Aglaia’s vision is that when stellar science is translated into great medicines for cancer patients, financial awards for those involved in this process will ultimately follow. In line with this philosophy, Aglaia has developed a tool to monitor the socio-economic impact of its investments in oncology biotech companies. For this purpose, Aglaia teamed up with the social impact consultancy firm Sinzer - now an affiliate of Grant Thornton. The joint development of a fully dedicated, highly versatile and flexible web-based platform for impact measuring and reporting in the life sciences industry, called Life Sciences Impact Suite, was completed in 2015.

If you want to learn more about Aglaia’s socio-economic performance to date, please reach out to us for further details.

Aglaia and Sinzer - Grant Thornton – made this social impact platform broadly available to the life sciences community, thereby fostering socio-economics ethics and a patient-centric culture in this industry.

[Aglaia Life Science Impact Suite](https://aglaia-oncology.com/media/uploads/file/Aglaia%20-%20Life%20Science%20Impact%20Suite%20def.pdf)

**Aglaia Management B.V. \| SFDR website disclosures**

In order to comply with the sustainable finance disclosure regulation ( **SFDR**) [\[1\]](https://aglaia-oncology.com/esg/#_ftn1 ""), Aglaia Management B.V. ( **Aglaia**) makes the following disclosures.

**Integration of sustainability risks**

A sustainability risk means:

_"an environmental, social or governance event or condition that, if it occurs, could cause an actual or potential material negative impact on the value of the investment"_

Aglaia views ESG as a standard topic in the pre-investment process. Before any investment decisions are made on behalf of any alternative investment fund ( **AIF**) that Aglaia manages, an investment decision process is followed which in regard to specific investments includes the assessment of potential sustainability risks attached to a potential investment opportunity, alongside other relevant factors such as the relevant AIF’s investment policy and objectives. . Any such risks identified are considered by Aglaia when making investment decisions.

Moreover, Aglaia in connection with certain AIF’s has created – in cooperation with Sinzer (a Grant Thornton company) - the Life Sciences Impact Suite; an indicator framework enabling measurement of the socio-economic impact of Life Sciences investments. It contains 50 impact indicators in 4 different themes: Science and Innovation, Clinical, Socio-Economical, and Financial. Since 2016, Aglaia has collected data on these indicators and tested them on relevance and feasibility. The collected data are then reviewed by the (the relevant) AIF for reporting purposes. This framework creates insight in the impact performance of projects, companies and the complete AIF that uses the Life Sciences Impact Suite.

**Sustainability and remuneration**

In addition, - when assessing the performance of its employees - Aglaia takes into account compliance with all policies and procedures which are in effect within Aglaia, including those relating to taking into account sustainability risks on the investment decision making process.

Employees are made aware of the applicable policies and procedures when starting their employment with Aglaia.

**No consideration of sustainability adverse impacts**

In accordance with article 4 sub 1 (b) of the SFDR, Aglaia states that it does not consider adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors as set forth in article 4 sub 1 (a) of the Disclosure Regulation and therefore does not make the disclosures as described in article 4 sub 1 (a) of the SFDR. Given the small size of the organisation of Aglaia, such disclosure as set forth in article 4 sub 1 (a) of the SFDR and the administrative burden in connection therewith would not be proportional.
