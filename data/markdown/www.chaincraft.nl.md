ChainCraft creates circular chemicals from food waste

### Fully bio-based

### Price competitive

### Trusted quality

## Turning chemistry circular

Petrochemicals and palm oil are unrenewable, destructive, and toxic to you and the planet.

ChainCraft supports the transition away from these compounds and replaces a variety of products with **bio-based chemicals made from food waste**. This is transforming the way we handle our waste and stimulating the implementation of sustainable circular processes across multiple industries.

**ChainCraft’s fatty acids are naturally produced by non-GMO fermentation of food waste**. Through this process, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) can be supplied to the agri-food and chemical & material industries. With quality that you can always trust to deliver the results you need.
