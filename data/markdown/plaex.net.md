# Automatic waste sorting bins forschools.events.universities.shopping malls.offices.stadiums.

Garby (our garbage bin) optimally sorts waste, reduces residual waste by 70%, and cuts waste pickup costs by 68%.

[The European Waste Management Association (FEAD)](https://fead.be/position/additional-mandatory-mixed-waste-sorting-systems-prior-to-incineration-are-not-the-silver-bullet-for-achieving-a-circular-economy/) "strongly supports the improvement and increase of 'source separation' as the most efficient and effective way to ensure quality recycling".

Sometimes the option to separate trash is not available

## The problem

When waste is not optimally sorted, it ends up in landfills, incinerators, or waterbodies.

In 2016, landfills alone released 1.9% of global greenhouse emissions. This was exactly the same amount released by the entire aviation industry!
