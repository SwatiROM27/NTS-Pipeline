The agricultural sector is constantly evolving and as a result the consumers demands keep changing. Continuous innovating is therefore a necessity. Innovation is driven by questions that we receive from our (international) clients in addition to our own questions. We make these innovations effective by delivering reliable and precise data. Since 2003, we develop new technologies with our clients that support the evolving agricultural sector and eventually make this sector more successful.

Product development includes 4 phases: design, characteristics, prototype and market introduction. Botany is the flexible and reliable partner in all phases of product development. Our structured approach and expertise results in an optimal and efficient product development process. This ensures successful introduction of a new product or application into the market. Knowledge and expertise are combined to determine the effectivity and safety of the new products or applications.

[**Innexo BV supports companies innovating in cannabis cultivation through independent research**\\
\\
Since April 1st, Innexo BV is officially licensed by the Dutch Government through the Medical Cannabis Agency to conduct research on cannabis plants for scientific purposes. After a successful audit by the Inspectorate for Healthcare and Youth (IGJ), Innexo is able focus on legal cannabis cultivation research for the next 5 years. Managing Director and co-owner of Innexo, Dominique van Gruisen, is very pleased with this evolution: "This is an important milestone. Not only for the company, but for everybody involved in the medical cannabis industry. We can now help companies that are active in the fields of technological development, genetic exploration, system builders, suppliers and licensed producers, to innovate in cannabis cultivation. More importantly, the research we conduct is practically oriented (applied research) and is independent. We are not producers, we are practically oriented researchers with many years of experience in medicinal plants. Through this license, we can partner with industry leaders to advance the much needed research in the production of cannabis for medical purposes."\\
