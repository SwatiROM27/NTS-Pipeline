## Models

Its design is completely contemporary but also very retro at the same time. The tank, the shape of the frame, the large front headlight and the small rear light are reminiscent of motorcycles from a bygone era. The Eysing Pioneers models are designed and developed with an eye for the smallest detail. Inspired by heritage, designed for the future. Built to last a lifetime.

## INSPIRED BY HERITAGE, DESIGNED FOR THE FUTURE

Built to last a lifetime.

## We are Eysing

Eysing is a Dutch company born out of a passion for automotive design. 4 Childhood friends started to design and built an e-moped for themselves based on the design of the classic Dutch Eysink motorbike, the Alpenjager, dated from 1938. They started the build in the backyard of their parents, learned, discussed, experimented till they had three riding Pioneer  prototypes. When they started to drive them on the road, the interest of bystanders was enormous. In 2018 the four friends introduced the first Pioneer prototype on the Masters Expo in Amsterdam. The interest was overwhelming and that was the start of the Eysing Company. The company was founded in 2017 in Vught (N-Brabant). After achieving a proof of concept, building several prototypes and testing these for tens of thousands of kilometers, they started a pre-sale in their own network. Advanced technical development of the 100 pre-ordered e-mopeds started in 2019 and took about 18 months.

They opened a concept store in ‘s-Hertogenbosch (N-Brabant) in 2019 and set up an assembly facility in Geffen (N-Brabant) in 2021. Assembly of the first production e-moped, the Eysing Pioneer, started in October 2020, resulting in first client deliveries by the end of that year. In 2021 they started our exclusive Tailor Made program. Besides the existing Pioneer line is it now possible to configure your own Pioneer Exclusive with all the specs you desire. In 2021 they also created an independent production facility approved by the RDW and they got the EU Type-Approval from the RDW. Moving to a bigger production facility was a must so they moved back to Vught (N-Brabant) in 2022, were it all begun in 2017. In 2022 they started several collaborations with international dealers and entered a huge collaboration with Pininfarina. The Eysing designed by Pininfarina, the PF40 is now a fact and available for pre-ordering.
