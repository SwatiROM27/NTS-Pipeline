## Metallurgy: Atakaş, Turkey

Capacity

220Nm3/hr

Quality

5,0hydrogen purity

Service & maintenance

2/ year

For Atakaş Steel in the south of Turkey, HyGear supplied two Hy.GEN Medium Plus® systems including a hydrogen compressor, a buffer tank, and a backup tank for the on-site hydrogen production. In this collaboration, the customer also entered a multi-year contract for both service and maintenance with HyGear. Atakas uses the hydrogen at their steel metallurgy plant for their high-quality galvanizing lines and annealing furnaces. For this, a high-purity hydrogen of 99.999% (5.0 purity) is needed.
