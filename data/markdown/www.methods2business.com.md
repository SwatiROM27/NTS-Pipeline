## Wi-Fi HaLow™ Technology

Wi-Fi HaLow extends Wi-Fi in the sub-GHz domain to provide superior IoT connectivity to smart devices over long distances with minimal power.

The new Wi-Fi standard is based on the IEEE802.11ah standard which is an integral part of the 802.11 standards family.

## Our Story

Changing the Game

About Us

​

Methods2Business (M2B) is a European semiconductor company on the leading edge of developing next generation Wi-Fi™ IP products for the global semiconductor chip market.  In collaboration with Imec in the Netherlands, the company demonstrated in 2016 the first Wi-Fi HaLow™ (IEEE 802.11ah) radio solution for Ultra-Low-Power IoT applications. Their joint low-power, long-range radio solution claimed to use 10 times less power than state-of-the-art orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radios on the market.

​

Today, Methods2Business is one of the leading IP suppliers of Wi-Fi HaLow™ SoCs for long range (up-to 1km), ultra-low power Wi-Fi connectivity in highly secured home and industrial IoT networks, including machine-to-machine communication. The company provides fully integrated MAC and Baseband IP for both stations and access points and delivers design services for IP customizations and Turn Key ASIC projects.

​

We work with Strong partners

​

The company builds on tight collaborations with Cadence and RF partners to provide   complete wireless modem chips for Wi-Fi HaLow™ stations and access points.

​

Methods2Business is a contributing member of Wi-Fi Alliance®, the worldwide network of companies that brings the world Wi-Fi®. The company plays a key role in the development of the Wi-Fi HaLow™ certification program.

Our passion is “First-Time-Right” IP

​

As an industry-leader in SystemC-based design methods, Methods2Business engineers build the full hardware, firmware and software of extremely complex Wi-Fi® IP products in extraordinarily short periods of time using Cadence world-class EDA tools and advanced Tensilica DSP technology. The approach not only furnishes fully integrated, high quality System-on-Chip solutions that can enter the market quickly, but also easy to customize IP blocks for dealing with late spec changes or for offering customers the ability to differentiate their end products. As Tensilica partner, the company is well positioned to better address low power requirements and complex challenges in station and access points by using artificial intelligence.

Founded in 2010, Methods2Business is headquartered in Eindhoven, Brainport region of The Netherlands, and has a design center in Novi Sad, Serbia.
