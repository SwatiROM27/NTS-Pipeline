##### “We don’t just design microbes — we build the bioprocesses and partnerships that bring them to market.”

## How can we help you?

**Whether you’re starting from an idea, a target molecule, or a strain already in production, we partner with you to design, engineer, and validate high-performance microbes — all in our own lab.**

Our proprietary Artemis platform combines metabolic modeling with machine learning to accelerate development, improve yield, and optimize even fully scaled processes using your real-world data. We go beyond strain design: EV Biotech can assess and engineer regulatory pathways at both the cellular and process level, ensuring robust, scalable performance under industrial conditions. From concept to commercial scale, we co-develop your bioprocess — and share in the success through royalties, licenses, or joint ventures.
