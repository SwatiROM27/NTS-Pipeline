### Multi-Laser Patterning module (MLP)

A modular, multi-laser exposure unit for high resolution, high productivity printing, independent of build plate size and fill ratio. Configurable for top-down or bottom-up printing, the MLP’s versatility and performance make it suitable for an incredible variety of machine and resin combinations.

- Lasers: 20 vertical beams

- Nominal resolution: 20 µm (5 - 40 µm)

- Wavelengths: 405 nm (385, 640, 1064 on roadmap)

- Power: 1000 – 4000 mW


- #### Productivity






At the heart of every MLP module is an **octagonal prism** that makes our process possible. But this heart doesn’t beat, it spins. Sitting on high-speed bearings, the spinning of this polygon allows the beam from **each diode** fired through it to obtain a surface scanning speed of over **25 m/s**, whilst maintaining a perpendicular interaction with the resin surface.

- #### High resolution






Each of the 20 diodes in each MLP module can address spots of 20 microns (and smaller in upcoming models).

- #### Modular build






The modular design of the MLP module allows the easy addition of further modules that work in parallel, extending the build size each time without sacrificing layer time or the perpendicularity of the beams.


### Resin suitability testing

We are currently demonstrating the capability of our MLP modules on various industrial resins, using our in house test and demonstration platform, the AMS One.

It is important that our customers are confident in both the excellent form accuracy and the material and mechanical properties achieved when using an MLP system.
