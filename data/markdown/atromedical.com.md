## ATRO Medical

A solution for post meniscectomy pain

ATRO Medical was founded by **Dr. Tony van Tienen** in 2016. When Van Tienen was working as an orthopedic knee surgeon, he encountered many patients who were suffering severe knee pain after a meniscus removal but were too young for a knee replacement. And their knee cartilage was actually too good to be replaced by metal and plastic. There was no fitting solution available, and as a result, these people experienced long episodes of pain.

ATRO Medical started as a spin-off from [Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg) and [DSM](https://www.dsm.com/nederland/nl_NL/home.html). After many years of academic research, these two parties decided assist van Tienen in launching a company to let the dream of an artificial meniscus come true.

**International input & partners**

ATRO Medical is a team of specialists that work hard towards a common goal: realizing a lasting,  innovative, and unique solution for patients with chronic knee pains. This requires knowledge, patience, and perseverance. With step-by-step improvements, we move closer to that goal.

Our efforts have been noticed internationally. ATRO Medical has received an important acknowledgment by the American government’s FDA, the ‘ **FDA breakthrough device designation**' In addition, the European Innovation Council ( [EIC](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/index_en)) has rewarded ATRO Medical with the **EIC Accelerator** grant, and [The Dutch Arthritis Society](https://reumanederland.nl/) has become an official partner.

**Join forces?**

ATRO Medical is always looking for partnerships. Are you a doctor, physiotherapist, radiologist, or insurer? Do you work for an orthopedic company or want to join forces another way? Please feel welcome to contact us.

#### Artificial outer meniscus for first patient

Patients

As the first company worldwide, ATRO Medical has started a clinical trial on a lateral artificial meniscus. For the first time ever, an absent meniscus in the outer knee compartment is replaced by an artificial meniscus, the Artimis® Meniscus Prosthesis. The first patient in this study has been treated at the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen.

#### Radboudumc and ATRO Medical start research on AI-generated artificial meniscus.

Professionals

The Orthopaedic Research Laboratory (ORL) of Radboudumc starts a new project with ATRO Medical: 3D-Printed PCU meniscus Prosthesis (3PPP). 3PPP combines the latest developments in sports medicine with the strength of AI. The durable meniscus prosthesis of ATRO Medical will be designed in 3D based on artificial intelligence, developed by the Orthopaedic Research Lab. Thanks to this technology, a scan of the healthy meniscus in one leg can be used to create a meniscus solution for the affected leg. In this way, the side with a lacking meniscus causing severe knee pain can receive a new shock absorber, molded to the individual patient.
