## About Us

### An innovative startup with unique expertise

We are a biotechnology company located in The Netherlands developing promising small molecule based therapies. We have discovered a novel mechanism that is based on selective intra-cellular functional protein expression inhibition, selectively occurring only in stressed and infected cells. Based on this novel mode of action, our portfolio of leads was designed and developed. Preclinical results so far have shown promising results.

## With continuous expansion

### Our Therapeutic Portfolio

#### Acute Ischemic Stroke

Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability in developed countries and one of the top causes of mortality worldwide.

#### Heart Failure

Despite improvements in therapy, the mortality rate of the estimated 23 million people with HF worldwide is still unacceptably high.

#### Alzheimer’s Disease

The estimated 53 million people with AD are affected from the low numbers of medication that reach the clinic, calling for a more stringent preclinical phase.

#### Viral Infections

The emergence of new viruses into the human population threatens global health and economic stability, as observed with the COVID-19 outbreak. Although virus-specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are possible solutions to this problem, it takes significant time (on average ten years) and capital ($2.8 to 3.7 billion per vaccine) to develop these interventions. Besides, the ongoing evolution of viruses may cause vaccines to become ineffective. Therefore, there is an urgent need for antiviral drug therapies that can be effectively applied for any viral disease, regardless of the virus type.

## Why Collaborate With Us

### Commercialization of drug candidates

After preclinical development of new drug candidates, Saillant Therapeutics is interested in pursuing licensing agreements with established pharmaceutical and biotech companies to enable further clinical development, registration and commercialization.
