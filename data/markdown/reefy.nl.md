#### One of our star engineering solutions:

## The Reef Enhancing Breakwater

At Reefy we are proud to introduce the first modular artificial reef that is stable enough to dissipate wave energy to protect the coast whilst providing the required substrate and habitat complexity to boost marine biodiversity. This patented innovation in coastal infrastructure is the REB: Reef Enhancing Breakwater.

The Reef Enhancing Breakwater is **available now** for your project. Contact us now to learn more about how the REB can transform your coastal initiatives and contribute to a healthier marine ecosystem.
