Bank – AML case

• Not fully compliant on all risks

• Risk of missing too many unusual transactions

• Complex legacy rulesets

• Too many False Positives

The bank could shift from individual rule definitions to a more holistic model, by configuring all risks into the Sygno AutoML solution for their new AML model. This Increased their risk coverage and at the while also reducing their existing ruleset complexity. The bank can now use the Sygno model, which focuses on good client behavior, to reveal previously unknown suspicious transactions (anomaly detection). The use of the Sygno model also resulted in a huge False Positive reduction, while at the same time an increase in potential SAR filings.

Bank- Fraud case

• Increase the pro-active and early fraud detection

• Manage time-to-market of models for new payment and fraud types

Sygno modeled the good or normal customer behavior of the clients of this bank, which resulted in anomalies that clearly sticked out. Sygno generated a more robust predictive model in fraud detection, which supported the bank inearly detection of emerging fraud patterns. Recognizing the “normal” behavior of the bank’s best customers reduced the False Positives substantially and improved the client experience, especially for those engaging in irregular or international payments. Time-to-market for the new model, and updates, is much faster (a couple of hours).

Credit Union- AML case

• Limited to no inhouse data science capability

• External models not effective for local risks and customers

By configuring all risks into the AutoML solution of Sygno, credit unions can ensure coverage of their local risk requirements, making the generated model applicable and effective for meeting their regulatory standards. Integrating these models into existing transaction monitoring systems allows for quick benefits without complex migrations, emphasising the importance of the right logic for identifying suspicious transactions. This model supports False Positive reduction and detection of more unusual transactions.
