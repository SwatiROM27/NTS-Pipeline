# perfect vision

At eyeo, we are pioneering the next generation of image sensors through our proprietary color splitting technology. Traditional image sensors rely on color filters, which absorb a significant portion of incoming light, leading to reduced sensitivity and image quality. Our innovative approach utilizes nano-photonic structures to split light, efficiently directing different wavelengths to the appropriate sensor pixels without the loss associated with conventional filters.
