# Together for a low-footprint food chain

Welcome to Protix, the global leader in high-quality, low-impact insect solutions for feed and farming. Our insect, the tiny black soldier fly, can make a big difference in lowering the environmental footprint of modern food production. Together with our customers, we're creating innovative insect-based solutions that benefit people and the planet.

Our mission

By  2050,  the  world  will  need  to  feed  around  10  billion  people  in  a  sustainable  way,  without  deforestation,  overfishing,  or  food  waste.  Therefore,  our  mission  is  to  bring  the  food  system  back  into  balance  with  nature,  using  insect  ingredients  and  solutions.

Small fly, big impact

## Towards a circular food system

Our current food system is broken. It depletes precious resources while one-third of all human food goes to waste.

With the help of our little black soldier fly we can transform this wasteful, linear food system into a circular model of reuse and renewal. Organic waste from the industry becomes feed for insects, and insects, in turn, are used as feed for animals.

This circular food production mirrors nature’s circle of life.

Changing the food system naturally

Insect solutions

## A natural fix

Inspired by nature, insects offer a powerful solution. Many animals naturally eat insects, because they are packed with protein and nutrients, making them an ideal ingredient for animal feed. Additionally, insects occur naturally in soil, where they benefit soil health and plant growth.

In our commercial production, we have chosen to work with the black soldier fly, which can eat almost any low-grade food waste and turns it efficiently into high-quality feed for both animals and plants.

Our work restores insects to their rightful place in the food system, as the natural link between waste and nutrition for animals and plants. By pairing natural processes with cutting-edge technology, we provide sustainable nutrition that helps feed the world's growing population.

## Benefits for health and nature

Our insect solutions are used in a wide range of feed and farming applications worldwide. No matter the sector or application, they provide a healthy, sustainable and natural food source. By harnessing the power of insects, we can transform the food system for the better.

### Healthy feed and food



Insect-based feed for animals and plants is nutritious and healthy. Many young animals in nature rely on insects as a rich source of protein and fat, providing essential energy and nutrients.

- ![](https://a.storyblok.com/f/292915/150x150/6d51715028/icon_earth.svg)



### Sustainable food system



The production of insect solutions has an ultra-low environmental footprint compared to traditional solutions, with minimal CO2 emissions, land and water usage, and significant reduction of food waste.

### Natural food chain



In nature, insects are a source of food for many animals and humans. Incorporating them into our food system reestablishes their vital role as a natural link between waste and nutrition, closing the natural cycle of life.

Towards a lower footprint with insects

## A positive impact every day

Our insect solutions for feed, food and farming use less land and water and emit less CO2 than conventional options such as poultry meal, fish meal and soy.

We measure our impact with the help of [the German Institute of Food Technologies.](https://www.dil-ev.de/en.html) Data shows that every kilogram of product from our plant significantly reduces CO2 emissions, conserves water, and minimizes land use. This helps protect vital ecosystems, preserve biodiversity, and safeguard natural resources.

Partnering with us helps manufacturers meet sustainability goals, comply with regulations, and respond to the rising demand for eco-friendly nutrition.
