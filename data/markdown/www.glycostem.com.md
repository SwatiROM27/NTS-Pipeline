# Taking cellular immunotherapy to the next level

We are focused on the development of stem cell-derived Natural Killer cells (NK cells) as a medicinal asset in the fight against cancer. NK cells are the new star in the domain of cellular immunotherapy, due to their tightly regulated “natural killing” of cancer cells; they play an important role in control and even cure of both solid and hematological malignancies, like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM).

## Pioneering, developing and manufacturing

Over the last decade we studied the role of NK cells in cancer treatment extensively and pioneered, developed and optimized our in-house NK-cell production processes.During our phase I safety study we verified our lead product oNKord® (naked NK cells) to be a safe therapeutic agent in the field of cellular immunotherapy. Currently we are developing our second generation product: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-engineered NK cells. A growing number of commercial and academic partners have chosen Glycostem because of our expertise with NK cells and their production.
