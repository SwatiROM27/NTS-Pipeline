# Process

In order to minimize risks or prevent incidents related to medical devices, manufacturers
should establish a system for risk management and a system for reporting of incidents and
field safety corrective actions.

This shows how the FSCA.com portal facilitates this process:

1

### The supplier publishes a Field Safety Notice (FSN)

After registration in the FSCA.com portal, the supplier operates in a secured environment. A new FSN is uploaded in the system easily. When the FSN meets all requirements of the FSCA.com portal, the FSN is sent to all affected healthcare providers. In addition a writing to confirm the FSN is sent to the senior management of the healthcare provider.

Part of the procedure is the option to offer alternate parts to the healthcare provider, in order to ensure continuation of the healthcare process.

2

### The healthcare provider takes measures requested in the FSN

A healthcare provider that is affected by the published FSN receives a message on behalf of the manufacturer. The healthcare provider is requested to take the defined measures and to fill in a sheet to confirm the actions taken. The manufacturer monitors this process using its secured account of the portal. After submitting the sheet the healthcare provider receives a confirmation message for its own file.

3

### Finalizing the FSN

Based on the defined due date reminders are sent to the healthcare providers that have not yet responded. The manufacturer receives a notification when all healthcare providers have submitted their data sheets. After collecting all data from the healthcare providers, the manufacturer finalizes the FSN. A comprehensive report including all correspondence with the healthcare providers can be downloaded and sent to the competent authority.
