# Easy to use

MedEye nurse is built to help nurses work faster and more safely during medication administration.

Medeye integrates seamlessly with hospital information

systems and is able to help nurses figure out which medications are due in a simple and natural way.

# Tablets and oral solids

MedEye Nurse comes with an intelligent scanner for solid oral medications.

With the Medeye scanner, a nurse can simply put all of the medications for a patient in a disposable tray, scan in seconds and verify they are correct. Unlike with barcodes, hospitals can verify all 5 rights - including the right dose - all in one go.

# All medications

MedEye comes with a "2nd eye" to help verify and document that the right medication

and dose is being given to the correct patient.

So whether it’s unmarked inhalers or barcoded ampules,

nurses can show it to MedEye and it will verify and register the administration.

# Second nurse

MedEye works as a second nurse - helping nurses figure out what medication patients are supposed to receive,

verifying the medication down to the exact dose, and handling all of the documentation required in the hospital information system.

This allows nurses to work more confidently, and with less stress.

# Education and Empowerment

MedEye provides an overview of what medications patients are taking in the hospital.

This shows the patients and loved ones what medication they’re taking, when they are taking them, and gives them more information about what the medication is.

With the MedEye app, patients are immediately involved in their own therapy.

Medication reminders are provided for self-administered medications.

With a click of a button, the patient is also able to document these self-administrations which is then visible in the hospital information system as a self administered and self documented medication administration.
