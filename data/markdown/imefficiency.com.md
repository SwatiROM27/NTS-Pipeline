## Transform your fleet with SolarOnTop

![Hitachi SolarOnTop](https://images.prismic.io/imefficiency/ef614885-fa19-4354-a413-f312890951ac_dji_fly_20221115_141116_279_1668518061691_photo.jpg?auto=compress,formatw800=&h=600)

Step 1: Transform your commercial vehicle into a solar-powered truck and unlock the power of renewable energy.

![Hitachi Solar-powered Truck](https://images.prismic.io/imefficiency/aeabd8fa-1433-4460-83d4-8855b492e533_TKF9501g.jpg?auto=compress,formatw800=&h=600)

Step 2: All you need is to install the **SolarOnTop kit**, including solar panels mounted on the truck's roof, a lithium battery, and an energy management system.

![Hitachi truck powered with solar energy](https://images.prismic.io/imefficiency/08f00444-173e-4c91-974e-619abe4bc9dd_dji_fly_20221115_141102_278_1668518063300_photo.jpg?auto=compress,formatw800=&h=600)

Step 3: Start reducing annual **fuel consumption** by 1,000 to 3,000+ liters and lowering **carbon emissions** by 3 to 9 tonnes of CO2, all while enjoying a rapid payback period.

“ We observe an average fuel savings of 4% to 5%. This varies depending on both the use of the tail lift and the number of kilometers driven. An additional advantage is that both the trailer's and the truck's batteries show less wear and tear and need to be replaced less frequently. ”

#### Vos Logistics Benelux Distribution

Norbert Reijnders, Fleet Manager

“ In this first year we already see that the SolarOnTop is delivering 60-70% of the energy demand. This Way the alternator is running less hours what also means a higher uptime of our trucks and batteries. This is a big advantage for our customers and employees. Because Heisterkamp can offer all the services a high grade of trust. ”

#### Heisterkamp Transport B.V

Chief operating officer.

“ Every initiative aimed at reducing emissions deserves careful consideration for its feasibility. Thanks to the SolarOnTop solution, we effectively cut our truck's fuel consumption by a percentage that justifies the investment and enables us to make a step towards a greener environment. ”

#### Van der Linden Hillegom B.V

Director

“ Thanks to SolarOnTop, we have a fully functional system that allows the driver to enjoy a cooled break and a good sleep without needing to wake up to start the engine. Even with temperatures above thirty degrees, the air conditioning unit keeps running on solar power. With SolarOnTop, our driver experiences a less stressful workweek, and our diesel fuel consumption has decreased, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. ”

#### Van Rijnsbergen

Anja Van Rijnsbergen, Business Owner

“ Multitrax vehicles are equipped with IM Efficiency's SolarOnTop system. Solar panels are installed on the roofs of the trailers, allowing energy to be stored in the SolarOnTop lithium battery. Thanks to its advanced management system, this energy is used to operate the Dhollandia hydraulic tailboard without the need for tractor power. As a result, loading and unloading operations are greener and quieter, particularly in urban settings. ”
