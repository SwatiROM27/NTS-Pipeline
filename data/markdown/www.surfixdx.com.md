Surfix’s mission is to advance global health by delivering accurate, accessible, and affordable diagnostic solutions for disease detection and management, specifically in underserved Point-of-Care (POC) testing segments.

To achieve this goal, Surfix has developed a photonic diagnostics platform that delivers exceptional sensitivity, accuracy, and a broad dynamic range. This cutting-edge technology enables diagnostics with precision surpassing traditional laboratory standards – a POCT with beyond lab-level precision.

**Driving Healthcare Forward**

Surfix’s objective is to continuously enhance the platform, ensuring it remains easy to use while offering reliable and sensitive detection of a wide array of biomarkers. By doing so, Surfix is committed to elevating healthcare standards and making advanced diagnostics accessible globally.

### Testing at the Point-of-Care

Obtaining fast and accurate diagnostic results for a patient’s health status can be challenging and complex. Delays in testing can significantly affect the quality of life, societal outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU).

**Key Statistics:**

- \> Approximately 70% of medical decisions today rely on laboratory test results.
- \> Most tests focus on a single biomarker.
- \> Average laboratory test result turnaround time: several days.
- \> Average cost per single biomarker test: €40.

**It’s time to change the paradigm!**

POC testing offers a rapid, decentralized, and cost-effective alternative to traditional lab tests. It simplifies the diagnostic process, making advanced healthcare accessible even in resource-limited settings.

Point-of-care testing has already reshaped the healthcare landscape and continues to drive transformative change. With the ability to provide immediate results, POC testing empowers better decision-making, enhances patient outcomes, and reduces healthcare costs.

### Game-Changing Technology

Surfix co-develops POC tests with its partners, leveraging its innovative photonic diagnostics platform that integrates six state-of-the-art technologies and consists of the following key components:

1. 1\. Photonic Biosensor: The core component, featuring a photonic chip and a microfluidic cartridge enhanced           with Surfix’s proprietary nanocoatings.
2. 2\. Dedicated Desktop Reader: A compact and efficient device that works seamlessly with the biosensor.

These technologies, each with a proven track record, are unified in Surfix’s platform to make the seemingly impossible possible for POC testing.

**Expanding Applications**

The platform’s versatility opens doors to breakthroughs in various fields, including:

- \> Drug development
- \> Antibiotic susceptibility testing
- \> Diagnosis and monitoring of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular conditions

Surfix’s photonic diagnostics platform represents the future of healthcare by making high-precision diagnostics available where and when they are needed most. For more information, please explore our technology and applications pages.
