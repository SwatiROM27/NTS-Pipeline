We are very happy to work with Team Staxxer! Their seamless communication and transparent, user-friendly portal have made managing VAT a breeze. No more juggling separate Amazon VAT transaction reports or dealing with other complex VAT tasks. Best of all, it's a huge time and money saverâ€”my accountant can now focus on growing my business instead of being bogged down with extra VAT administration.

And one more thing we love: Staxxerâ€™s handy browser extension that lets me download all my Amazon invoices in one go. Such a great feature!

Staxxer handles our OSS, German, and UK tax returns. Over the course of a few years, the company has grown into a highly professional organization, where the communication between us and Staxxer runs very smoothly. A company that understands that, as a seller, you'd rather focus on entrepreneurship and optimizing your products instead of spending a lot of time on tax returns. Highly recommended!
An absolute must!

## Do you have a question?

If yours isnâ€™t listed, give us a call.

Want to apply for a European VAT number?

Do you have inventory stored abroad because you sell through Amazon FBA, for example, or use a European fulfillment center? Then you need an European VAT registration in that country! Save yourself the paperwork and let us apply for your VAT registration.

**Where can I use the VAT registration?**

You can use the VAT number for any business purpose. For example, when selling through Amazon, Bol.com, Shopify or another platform. The number is also valid if you are going to do business locally that requires a European VAT number.

Want to outsource European VAT returns?

If you have a VAT registration abroad, you will also have to file VAT returns there. How often and when to do so, depends on the country. It can be monthly, or quarterly.

We understand that you donâ€™t feel like doing all the VAT administration. So leave it to us: link your sales accounts to Staxxer, so we can always accurately file your European VAT return. Then you wonâ€™t spend any more time on VAT returns.

Want your One Stop Shop (OSS) declaration done?

July 1, 2021, the One Stop Shop went into effect, also known as the One-Stop Shop system. Do you sell more than â‚¬10,000.- across borders every year? Through this new regulation, you declare your VAT of all the countries in which you do business at once. If you have all your stock in your country of residence, you no longer need a VAT number in those other countries. In the One Stop Shop declaration, you declare every cross-border sale within the EU.

That involves quite a bit of math. Especially if you sell through multiple platforms! Weâ€™ve come up with something on that: you can link all your sales channels (Amazon, Bol.com, Shopify and more) to Staxxer. This way you always have all your VAT data at hand, and within 5 minutes you have your One Stop Shop declaration arranged. Staxxer does the calculations, and our Staxxers handle the declaration further. Handy right?

In which countries can you do my VAT?

We can arrange VAT registration for you in any EU country, and do VAT returns for you in any EU country.

Donâ€™t see your country listed on our product page? If so, contact support and weâ€™ll see what we can do.

When do I need a VAT number?

You need a VAT number when you store stock in another EU country or when you go over a countryâ€™s threshold amount. You need to keep an eye on this: especially if you sell through marketplaces such as Amazon, Bol.com or Shopify.

Not sure if you need a VAT number? Letâ€™s have a chat. We can also apply for a VAT number for you.
