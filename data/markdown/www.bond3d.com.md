# Rethinking engineering   and manufacturing in  3D PEEK Printing

Bond3D is on a mission to transform the manufacturing of essential parts for critical applications. We create cutting-edge [technology](https://www.bond3d.com/technology/index.html) that takes [high-performance polymers](https://www.bond3d.com/high-performance-polymers/index.html) into the future of additive manufacturing. Not just for single prototypes, but for production at an industrial scale.

We work with engineers around the world to create impossible parts with unseen capabilities in the most demanding businesses. Faster, cheaper, and better than ever before.

## Microns make a  huge difference   in voidless printing

Bond3D’s unique technology combines all the great properties of the [PEEK](https://www.bond3d.com/peek/index.html) base material with the benefits of additive manufacturing. Bond3D creates parts that have isotropic strength in all directions and are 100% voidless. That means making high-end products with fewer components, less weight, and less waste. For the first time, printed parts are certified for use in critical applications.
