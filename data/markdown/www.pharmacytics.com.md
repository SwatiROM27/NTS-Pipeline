Product Innovation & Patient Impact

# CREATING UNIQUE AND ADVANCED PRODRUGS

## OUR NUTRIENT DRUG CONJUGATE TECHNOLOGY (NDCt)â„¢

- turns parenteral compounds into oral variants or improves oral bioavailability
- uses specific transporter proteins for food, i.e. **active** transport over the gut wall
- delivers tailor made solutions with our toolbox of linkers and nutrient

Our focus is to provide innovative solutions to improve suboptimal properties of small-molecule drugs. One of our main drug delivery projects is to facilitate transport of biomolecules through cellular membranes.

By combining knowledge of cellular processes with medicinal chemistry expertise, we have developed proprietary technology to solve bioavailability issues of (oral) medication by exploiting the transport capacity of specific carrier proteins abundantly present in the intestinal wall.

We have developed a Toolbox of 22 linkers and 6 nutrient mimics that allows to pick and choose based on the presented molecule.

Our technology also holds promise to facilitate uptake of anticancer drugs into tumor cells and to enable passage of CNS active compounds through the blood-brain barrier.

## CREATING THE NEXT GENERATION PRODRUGS

### PATIENT BENEFITS

- Oral administration is by far the preferred route and GI side effects may diminish, both improving compliance and with that efficacy
- Enhanced bioavailability gives less inter-patient variability
- New indications for the same compound

### PATIENT BENEFITS

- Oral administration is by far the preferred route and GI side effects may diminish, both improving compliance and with that efficacy
- Enhanced bioavailability gives less inter-patient variability
- New indications for the same compound

### BENEFITS TO COMPANIES

- Life cycle management from an NCE (new IP, often COM)
- Short route to approval
- NDCt platform broadly applicable, irrespective of disease area
- Accelerate development of pipeline products
- Once promising, but now shelved research, can be revived
