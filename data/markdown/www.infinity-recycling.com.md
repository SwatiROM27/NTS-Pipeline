### Execution

Leverage market experience to commercialise and scale technologies

### Solving the    waste problem

##### Create a circular plastic economy

Infinity Recycling is established by Jan Willem Muller and Jeroen Kelder to bring a return-driven approach to sustainability. The team's experience in trading commodities and corporate finance provides considerable value to the technology companies, helping them to convert valuable IP into profitable, scalable businesses.

The team's philosophy is to look at the value of a commodity first, and then work backwards. By investing in advanced recycling technologies, the firm profitably converts non-recyclable waste into chemical feedstock or fuels, thereby giving waste a value. Whilst at the same time lowering the CO2 footprint of the plastics economy and creating a true circular economy.

### We need to    act now

Plastic production increased exponentially, from 2.3 million tons in 1950 to 488 million tons today. Production is expected to more than triple by 2050.


The linear consumption of plastic and the lack of appropriate recycling infrastructure has led to plastic waste swamping rivers and oceans. This has now become one of the world's most pressing issues.


Read More

The rapidly increasing production of plastic products overwhelms the world's ability to deal with the waste. Advancement in technologies will enable us to increase the mechanical recycling percentages, but more than 50% of the waste streams can never be mechanically recycled due to the chemical nature of plastics and the way in which we use it.

Advanced recycling brings the solution for these,

non recyclable waste streams, enabling a transformation from a linear economy to a sustainable circular economy.

The advanced recycling technology developed by Alterra not only reduces plastic waste by re-using plastic materials but also unlocks new economic opportunities. We are thrilled to be part of this transformative effort."


Martino Gabellich, Vice President of Advanced Recycling and Low Carbon Solutions at LyondellBasell, remarked, "Our investment in Alterra demonstrates our commitment to capturing value from plastic waste and preventing it from going to incineration or landfills. These continuous investments along the value chain will help us scale our range of circular and low carbon solutions for our customers, while also contributing to the efforts to build a circular economy that benefits society and the planet."


Benny Mermans, Vice President of Sustainability at Chevron Phillips Chemical, remarked, "This investment in Alterra reflects our company's broader sustainability goals, including collaborating globally to advance the circular economy. We support ending plastic waste in the environment by sustainably recycling used plastics to create new and valuable products."
