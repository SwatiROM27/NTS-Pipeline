### An admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a profound event for patients and their families.

Processing this period becomes easier when family, friends, and ICU staff keep a diary during the admission. Post-ICU is the digital, secure, and private diary to prevent or alleviate Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) for both patients and families. Studies have shown that journaling benefits ICU healthcare workers as well.

#### “I would like to emphasize that the digital diary is a very good initiative. It is not only a clear overview for my sister, but it is also valuable for me to process this tense experience.” - Post-ICU User

Even a couple of days before my ICU admission, my memory is a blank. By looking at photos in Post-ICU, a lot of things became clear for me. I finally understood what the situation back then was like.

The digital diary in the intensive care is a fantastic tool for quickly intensifying communication with the patient and their family, so that we can better understand who the patient is.

A patient once said to me: ‘It seemed as if I had taken the express train, while my wife took the local train.’ The wife had many more moments when they thought, ‘We're about to lose him,’ during difficult conversations or something like that. Meanwhile, that patient knew nothing about it; they were somewhere completely different from us. That's why the Post-ICU diaries are great; the patient can see and understand where they've been.
