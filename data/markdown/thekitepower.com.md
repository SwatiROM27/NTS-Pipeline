![Battery swap](https://thekitepower.com/wp-content/uploads/tooltip-plus-blue.png)

**Batteries** are swapped to be charged at a charging hub and delivered back to the construction site. This
process creates logistical complexities, time loss and costs. What if electricity could be generated on site?

![Electric machinery](https://thekitepower.com/wp-content/uploads/tooltip-plus-blue.png)

More and more **construction machinery is becoming electric** which results in a higher demand for clean
charging solutions. With Kitepower, a zero-emission construction site becomes reality.

![Diesel generator](https://thekitepower.com/wp-content/uploads/tooltip-plus-blue.png)

**Polluting and noisy generators** are used at construction sites, with Kitepower fossil fuels can be
eliminated. With prohibited use of diesel at more and more sites, there is a need for alternative clean energy
sources.

![Kitepower system](https://thekitepower.com/wp-content/uploads/tooltip-plus-blue.png)

**Mobile, temporary and renewable wind energy** generation on the construction site. The Kitepower team
(remotely) operates the system allowing the work crew to continue their day-to-day tasks uninterrupted. The kite flies at an altitude of 350 meters in an efficient figure eight-pattern.

For **remote construction within or near Natura2000** protected areas, zero-emission is made easy with
Kitepower.

Kitepower's Airborne Wind Energy

## Beyond Boundaries:  Wind Energy Redefined

## Integrate Kitepower into your microgrid to reap the benefits of airborne wind energy generation

[Find out more](https://thekitepower.com/markets)

## Avoid Idle Generators & Save Diesel Off-The-Grid

When integrating Kitepower in combination with batteries, diesel generators can be switched off completely. Hybridising with Kitepower results in less diesel consumption for more clean energy, culminating in considerable financial savings even for areas that do not experience consistent high wind speeds. Using Kitepower on your site instead of swapping batteries reduces logistics, saves time and cuts costs.

## Those Who Build Infrastructure & the Future

The urgency for sustainable energy use in construction is rising. By 2030, a significant share of machinery will need to be electric-powered in the Netherlands. At the same time, net congestion is driving demand for independent and mobile energy systems for remote construction sites. Kitepower provides temporary, emission-free and scalable wind energy for project-based deployment.

## Those Who Harvest Crops & Winds

An increasing number of landowners are now adding to their incomes by harvesting the wind that blows across their land to make electricity. Kitepower’s renewable energy can be used at your areas of operations to replace other fuels or sold as a “cash crop”. Farmers are therefore in an unique position to benefit from the growth in the wind industry. Moreover, whereas 530 kWp solar pv averagely uses more than an acre, Kitepower would cover approximately 6 x 2,5 m of ground allowing farmers to further optimise their arable areas. With Kitepower farmers can generate their own clean power, avoiding visual and acoustic pollution, and ultimately becoming less dependent on the grid.

## Tax Advantages And Incentive Programmes

Between federal investment programmes, tax credit programs, feed-in tariffs and the ability to claim depreciation on wind energy systems, an investment in Kitepower’s AWE translates to real value.

## Emancipate From Fossil Fuels

The decade we just entered is going to be the decade where every day will be crucial in deciding what the future will look like. In other words, this must be the decade when all investments and subsidies allocated to fossil fuel exploration and extraction end, this must be the decade when humankind divests and emancipates from fossil fuels.

The Kitepower systems currently in development are ideally suited to replace diesel generator sets in remote locations to save costs and mitigate dependency on polluting and expensive diesel supply. Kitepower aims to significantly change how the world’s energy demands are met by easing the deployment of distributed wind energy systems: The versatility of a Kitepower system is able to open up new geographical markets for the generation of wind energy and majorly contribute to the global energy transition to renewables.

Kitepower is one of the interesting possibilities of energy supply. We see the application as Defence in the operational and civil domain, it has social added value. This is one of the reasons for Defence to participate in this project. This offers opportunities, especially in remote and windy areas such as islands.

_Paul van der Heul_

Lieutenant Colonel,
Koninklijke Landmacht

We are investing in Kitepower because it has developed an interesting technology that can have a significant impact on CO2 reduction in remote areas and locations requiring temporary power by offering a fossil-free alternative to polluting diesel generators. ENERGIIQ has every confidence in Kitepower’s management team and looks forward to driving this proposition forward.

_Rafael Koene_

Fund Manager,
ENERGIIQ

We believe Kitepower will be a catalyst for airborne wind energy, thereby enabling renewable energy for a completely new segment. We are excited about the years ahead and will support Kitepower in the further commercialisation of the technology throughout.

_Stefan van Eijk_

Fund Manager,
Stichting ifund

Let the kite fly until you have fully replaced coal, oil and gas as energy sources and have solved our climate crisis. Then relax and enjoy life.

_Udo Zillmann_

Secretary General,
AWEurope

Kitepower offers a new interesting wind energy solution to the market (because of its innovative character) \[…\] We believe that Kitepower has the potential to play a significant role in increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix of the future \[…\]

_Daan Grooten_

Head of Innovation,
Qurrent

One should not pursue goals that are easily achieved. One must develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through one’s greatest efforts.

_Albert Einstein_

Airborne wind systems offer the potential to harvest significant amount of wind energy at a fraction of the material used in traditional wind turbine systems. \[…\] Fully autonomous operation is on the edge of realisation making these systems excellent candidates for producing the cheapest green electricity ever.

_Gerard van Bussel_

Wind Energy Emeritus Professor,
TU Delft

The big advantage of kites is that there is hardly any pollution of the horizon because the kites operate at a very high altitude.
