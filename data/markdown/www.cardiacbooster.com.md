Next generation

Developing a high-flow, low-profile percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) for cardiogenic shock and high-risk PCI is crucial in advancing cardiac care and improving patient outcomes, as it allows for effective hemodynamic support while minimizing procedure invasiveness.

Cardiac Support

Physicians use percutaneous ventricular assist devices to temporarily support patients through periods of hemodynamic instability. Ventricular assist devices provide temporary cardiac support to cardiogenic shock patients and to patients undergoing high-risk coronary procedures.

### Cardiac Support

Physicians use mechanical ventricular assist devices to support patients through periods of hemodynamic instability. Ventricular assist devices used for short-term support are usually brought into the patient through minimally invasive methods, mostly by accessing blood vessels in the groin (percutaneous delivery).

### Cardiogenic Shock

Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency characterized by the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood volume for adequate organ and tissue perfusion. Cardiogenic shock carries a dire prognosis with a high in-hospital mortality.

### High Risk PCI

Percutaneous coronary procedures allow the minimally invasive treatment of coronary artery disease. These procedures are a mainstay of interventional cardiology and usually uneventful. However, some procedures carry an elevated risk either due to the physiological or anatomical condition of the patient, or the complexity of a particular procedure, and are deemed high-risk procedures (high-risk PCI).
