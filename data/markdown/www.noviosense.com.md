**Successful Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results** \\
\\
NovioSense has demonstrated the measurement of tear glucose in diabetic patients and the correlation to blood glucose with clinically relevant accuracy. The company announced the commencement of a second, 24-patient study, to validate the use of its tear glucose sensor in type 1 diabetic patients.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181025005032/en/NovioSense-Announces-Positive-Phase-2-Clinical-Trial)

**NovioSense is a revolution in non-invasive glucose monitoring** \\
\\
We have discovered that by harnessing the power of tears to determine blood glucose levels NovioSense will free diabetics from the painful finger prick. We have reimagined the way diabetic patients measure glucose. We have redesigned the traditional finger prick glucose sensor into a NovioSense. NovioSense is a small flexible device that sits in the lower eyelid. The device is wirelessly powered and compatible with NFC enabled smart phones](https://www.noviosense.com/NovioSense)

**Glucose monitoring does not need to be painful** \\
\\
By reimagining the finger strip technology into a new form factor our non-invasive device will allow patients to monitor glucose levels on demand not only non-invasively but also unobtrusively. We have discovered that tears are a unique source of biomarkers with excellent prediction of blood biomarker levels. Armed with this knowledge we have developed a non-invasive sensor capable of detecting trace levels of glucose in tears and accurately extrapolating these values back to blood glucose levels.](https://www.noviosense.com/NovioSense)

**NovioSense TuDelft and Adidas to develop sensors to prevent sports injury** \\
\\
Better sports performance through injury preventionâ€™ There are 4.5 million injuries in the Netherlands each year, incurring 5 billion euros in direct medical costs. Half of these injuries could be prevented, for example by feeding information back to the athlete using sensor and data-science technology, and by using smart feedback equipment based on psychological knowledge to influence behaviour. In order to prevent injuries, the programme will develop three lines of research, looking at sensor technology, data-processing and feedback.](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2017/tu-delft/tu-delft-to-lead-three-new-large-scale-public-private-research-programmes/)

Finger Prick Glucose

The majority of diabetics have a painful daily reminder of their disease in the form of a finger prick.
