## The circular solution for citrus peels

Do you like to drink fresh juice? The press devices in supermarkets and catering establishments deliver a huge amount of orange peels. PeelPioneers has the mission to save all citrus residues and convert them into valuable ingredients. By doing so we offer the citrus residues a second life.

We extract natural ingredients from the peel which are widely used in food products, cosmetics and cleaning products. This way, we reuse 100% of the peel. See [here](https://peelpioneers.nl/applications/) which ingredients are suitable for your application.

In our innovation lab we constantly research how to obtain more value out of the peels. As a result of that research we launch the Finix citrus fiber, which provides firmness, structure and the right mouthfeel to, for example,  meat substitutes and muffins. By using our ingredients, you are part of the circular solution. This is how we make a difference together!

Our entire process of transforming orange peels into orangeade, essential oil, and fiber meets international standards. We are certified for both our food and animal feed streams, including citrus pulp and citrus water. As a result, our ingredients are applicable in every domain, including food, cosmetics, and cleaning products.

Our sustainable ingredients are not only applicable in a variety of domains, but they are also plant-based, natural, non-GMO, and gluten-free. This means that our “appeeling” ingredients can take your products to the next level!
