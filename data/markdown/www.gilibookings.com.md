Reliable services from Serangan harbour in Bali to the Gili Islands is available with Blue Water Express and Gili Getaway, offering one of the fastest fast boat services available. Eka Jaya fast boat, Blue Water Express and Gili Gili Fast boat operate out of Padang Bai and stop at Gili Trawangan, Gili Air and Lombok.

**WARNING**: Always make sure that the ticket you are buying is actually for the boat company that you want to travel with. There are unfortunately a number of websites that run a scam that involves selling tickets to customers on one of the reputable boat companies, but when they arrive at the harbour they discover that they are booked with one of the less reliable boat companies. The usual excuse is that the boat company the customers thought they were going to travel on was full or had a technical problem.
