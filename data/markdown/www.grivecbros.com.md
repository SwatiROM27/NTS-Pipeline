## BRICKER ECRU WASHED

[SHOP here](https://grivecbros.com/products/limited-edition-bricker-short-japanese-lightweight-indigo-yarn-dyed-kopie)

\[ Bricker \]
I’m Bricker. I was created in 2017 as a loose tapered jeans. I’m the one that lights the
fire. Back in the old days, the coalminers carrying the coal bricks were called
‘Brickers’. It’s a name I carry with pride. In fact, you can see it when you look at me.
As if they were little flames, stitches of orange and tobacco run through my denim.
May that subtle detail remind you that wherever you take me, I will bring the potential
for fire.

First Class From Start to Finish

I came across the Grivec Bros. due to the collaboration with Denham so thought I would give them a try. I was unsure of the size and fit due to being from the UK and unable to try them on etc. I emailed for some advice and the level of support and advice I received from Marcel was amazing! When the Jeans (Hower 14oz) arrived the quality was unreal and the fit was exactly as was described and the size to go for, as advised by Marcel, was spot on. Service from start to finish has been brilliant as were the jeans. I would recommend these guys 100%, I will certainly be back!

Vakmanschap

Ben zeer tevreden met de Hower van Grivec Bros. De fit is zeer goed (niet te strak, niet te wijd) en de broek is middels vakmanschap en liefde voor jeans in elkaar gezet.

Second skin after 3 years of loyal service

The best pair of Jeans I ever had... They feel like a comfy second skin after almost 3 years of loyal service and it looks like these jeans will last for a few more years to come.

Awesome color fading as time passes by is a visual treat that comes on top of the proven quality for free!

## WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT OUR JEANS?

Our jeans are made of japanase raw denim. This is not the normal type of denim you are probably used to. It is the highest quality of jeans in the most natural state you can get. It naturally fades through time, creating a unique beauty. We created 4 models for any type of fit you might like. Try and enjoy.
