### A world where **distance** doesn’t matter.

Word Replacement

Hyperloop is

the most sustainable

solution.

_Hyperloop is a transportation system where vehicles float on magnetic fields and move through low-pressure tubes. It is highly energy-efficient, using only 10% of the energy needed for roads and aviation, and 50% less energy than rail._

### **Why Hyperloop?**

Not only does the hyperloop produce **no noise, vibration, or pollution**, but it also **doesn't intersect with other infrastructures**. Additionally, it can seamlessly **blend into urban and natural surroundings.** Overall, the hyperloop offers the most sustainable solution to meet the increasing demand for transportation

### **High Speed**

Hyperloop has a top speed of 700 km/hr, and average speeds of ~500 km/hr. Due to the low pressure environment inside the tube this is achieved with minimal energy usage.

### **Low Costs**

Hyperloop infrastructure implementation costs are cheaper compared to high-speed rail due to the low land-use of the infrastructure and pre-fabricated infrastructure components. Operational costs are lower because of magnetic levitation, requiring minimal maintenance. This results in competitive ticket prices for passengers.

### **High Capacity**

Hyperloop has short headways (seconds instead of minutes), offerin superior capacity up to 20.000 pax/h/direction. It enables more trips per hour compared to trains.

### **We provide an open, passive infrastructure specification**

[Learn more about the European Hyperloop Center](https://hyperloopcenter.eu/)

We have initiated the European Hyperloop Center—an advanced open facility where Hardt, alongside other developers, will test hyperloop vehicles. This center acts as a hub for refining and validating the open specifications, allowing various stakeholders to contribute to the ongoing evolution of hyperloop technology.

### We initiate, we mobilize, and we get things done

- ## Hardt has built Europe's first full-scale hyperloop test facility

- ## Hardt is the supplier of the core hyperloop system for the 420-meter European Hyperloop Center

- ## Hardt has built the Hyperloop Experience Center for people to learn about hyperloop

- ## Hardt has demonstrated world's first lane switch without moving components

- ## Hardt has tested hyperloop propulsion up to 300 km/h with a prototype

- ## Hardt is one of the initiators of the official European hyperloop standard
