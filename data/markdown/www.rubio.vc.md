## Fully aligned with our entrepreneurs – and their missions

At Rubio, we do VC differently. We believe that the success of an impact VC is proven by achieving ambitious impact and financial goals. That’s why 100% of our performance fees are directly linked to (externally validated) quantifiable impact targets as well as financial goals.

We love sharing the story of our collective impact so far – so make sure you read our latest annual [Rubio Impact Report 2024](https://impactreport.rubio.vc/)
