A unique concept with a special promise

## The mattress

Our mattress offers a unique experience, allowing you to adjust not only the firmness but also the zonal support to match your body and sleeping position. Due to its smart design, the mattress maintains the optimal foam layer sequence with every adjustment, ensuring superior support, maximum comfort, and excellent ventilation. It‚Äôs no wonder this is the highest-rated mattress in the Netherlands.

### What our customers are saying

‚ÄúFinally a great mattress!‚Äù

Finally, after trying two mattresses (Emma and Matt were my previous experiences), I‚Äôve found a great mattress. I‚Äôve only slept on it for two nights, but I‚Äôm already used to it. Another advantage is that they offer all sizes (longer than 200 cm), as finding a mattress in that size is much harder. Communication is easy and hassle-free. üôÇ

###### Martijn Schutz

We ordered the Morningstar bed \*\*Bela\*\* (200√ó200) with two 18cm mattresses and a topper‚Äîwhat an experience! With three kids regularly jumping into bed, we needed the space. The reversible mattresses combined with the topper are the perfect solution for a great night‚Äôs sleep, especially with the weight difference between my wife and me. We are absolutely thrilled with this purchase! And the luxurious look is a feast for the eyes.
