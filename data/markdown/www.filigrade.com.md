### European brand name for digital watermarks

FiliGrade Sustainable Watermarks, has been developing and innovating digital watermarks since 2014.

**CurvCode** is the European brand name for our digital watermarks for sorting waste, both post-consumer and industrial waste.

FiliGrade innovations for embedding CurvCodes in moulds and print are **PCT PATENTED or PATENT PENDING**.

CurvCode digital watermark technology offers three unique features:

- **Single purpose**: effective sorting of plastic and fiber based waste is the sole purpose of CurvCode. CurvCode software does not store sensitive brand-owner data.
- **Low-cost**: the investment requirement for implementing CurvCode are very low compared to alternative technologies.
- **Reliable**: simple and fault-tolerant ICT architecture and the use of standard components (monochrome camera’s and LED lighting) requiring minimal PC power ensures reliable operation of CurvCode detection systems in the chalenging conditions encountered in waste-handling and sorting facilities.
