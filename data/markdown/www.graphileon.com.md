# Create highly interactive applications in a matter of hours

Create a graph-model of your customer's data by clicking and pointing. Create meaningful interactions between grids, charts, networks and other views. No coding, just link queries to views, to queries .. to views ..

- Use virtual aggregates to simplify presentations.
- Create, edit, display, or copy & paste nodes and relations using multiple panels.
- View and load node neighbours in a controlled way.
- Style your nodes using icons, colours and shapes. Style definitions can include conditions.
- Save visualisations as diagrams or as images.

## Get started with Graphileon Personal Edition in the cloud or on your desktop.

The easiest way to get to know Graphileon is to spin up the Personal Edition in the Graphileon Cloud. It comes with two graph stores installed and access to the App Library with examples and apps. You can also download and install Graphileon Personal Edition to run it on your desktop. Either way, you will be able to build graphy applications an browse your graph stores in a way you never did before.
