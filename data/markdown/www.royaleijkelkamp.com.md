### Soil health




Healthy soil is important for all of us. If our soils are healthy, crops grow well and we have few problems with plant diseases. A healthy soil has a crumbly structure, good drainage and retains sufficient moisture. By working on soil health, compaction, flooding, drought, erosion and problems with crop growth are prevented. A healthy soil is also a habitat for soil life, thus contributing to biodiversity.

**The importance of blue-green algae monitoring** \\
\\
When the days get warmer in spring and summer, the risk of blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, increases. Continuous measurement can help to get a better grip on blue-green algae. You can detect when algal blooms occur in real time, and take timely measures to prevent worse problems. \\

**The Giant hogweed, an invasive species** \\
\\
Plants, animals or other organisms that do not naturally occur in a country are called invasive species. These invasive species end up in a country by human activity. Some feel so at home in their new environment that they establish themselves in nature and multiply. If that is the case, they are called invasive species.\\

**Trafficability of construction sites** \\
\\
Toppling cranes, lorries getting stuck causing construction works to come to a standstill, personnel slipping or sinking and then staying home as a result of their injuries; these are some of the dangerous situations that occur when the ground of a construction site has insufficient load-bearing capacity. This prompted the ‘Federation of Piling Specialists’ (FPS) to develop the Working Platform Certificate (WPC) a number of years ago.\\

**Soil compaction, an underestimated problem** \\
\\
Soil compaction is becoming a major issue worldwide. Not only in the Netherlands but globally the soil is deteriorating very badly. Soil compaction is a form of soil degradation, in which the soil structure is lost because the soil is compressed. This global problem is still underestimated and causes problems for agriculture, nature, and climate. Furthermore, soil compaction leads to loss of yield, loss of quality, and reduced water storage.\\
