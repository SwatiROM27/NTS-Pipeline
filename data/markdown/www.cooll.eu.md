# An energy-efficient and affordable heating solution

Cooll’s thermally driven heat pump replaces the condensing boiler in existing or new homes. It is powered by natural gas or hydrogen and compatible with both high- and low-temperature heating. It achieves a reduction on gas usage and CO2 emissions of 25-40% without increasing electricity consumption.

## How does our technology work?

A unique feature of our [patented technology](https://cooll.com/technology/) is the compression of refrigerant with a heat-driven **adsorption compressor**. The required heat comes from burning gas or hydrogen. To quickly understand how it works and why it sets us apart from our competitors, we’ve created the short video below.

Cooll Thermally Driven Heat Pump

## Adsorption heat pump at The Green Village

We are currently testing our thermally driven heat pump at [The Green Village](https://www.thegreenvillage.org/project/cooll-adsorptiewarmtepomp/ "Visit the project page at The Green Village"), a regulation-free ‘open-air laboratory’ on TU Delft Campus. Our focus lies on gas savings, ease of installation and improving robustness. The [DreamHûs field test](https://cooll.com/the-green-village/ "Cooll and The Green Village") forms the basis for our upcoming hydrogen pilot. Co-founder Stefan van Uffelen tells you more about it in the video below.

## What is our target audience?

The past 20 years have been all about development. Our technology has now advanced to such an extent that it’s ready for commercialisation. We don’t want to go to mass production ourselves. Instead, we’re searching globally for partners to cooperate or implement our certified technology.



### [HVAC professionals](https://cooll.com/partners/)

We are looking for HVAC companies that produce condensing boilers or heat pumps, but see added value in the implementation of our thermally driven heat pump technology into their line of products.



### [Capital investors](https://cooll.com/partners/)

We’ve been funded by our founders, informal investors, private investors, Dutch grants and European subsidies. To scale up in Europe, the United States and Asia, we’re looking for additional capital.



### [Governments](https://cooll.com/partners/)

We would like to get in touch with governmental bodies which have defined concrete targets to reduce carbon emissions but want to achieve those with minimal impact on the electricity grid.
