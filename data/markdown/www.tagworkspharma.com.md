# Click-to-Release Technology

We have built a leading technology that enables controlled drug release induced by an in vivo click reaction with a trigger molecule with the aim to increase the therapeutic window and utility of potent systemic therapies. Key applications include the on-target activation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and immunomodulators in the tumor microenvironment, as well as the off-target deactivation of unwanted circulating radiopharmaceuticals.

# Expanding the Therapeutic Potential of ADCs

Conventional ADCs are limited to suitable internalizing targets, which are not necessarily expressed by every cancer type and cancer cell. We are leveraging our Click-to-Release approach to expand the ADC target scope to non- or poorly internalizing receptors and markers. It also enables controlled drug release with a broad bystander effect that makes it possible to kill tumors with heterogenous target expression. Our lead program, TGW101, is a click-cleavable ADC targeting TAG72, a clinically validated non-internalizing target that is widely expressed in solid tumors, but which has so far remained out of reach of current ADC therapies.
