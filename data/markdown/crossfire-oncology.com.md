Aberrant functioning of kinases is known to be an important driver in cancer. Targeting hereof has proven to be extremely successful and has already revolutionized the management of numerous types of cancer.

At Crossfire we approach kinases from three different angles: inhibitors, degraders, and degrader antibody conjugates. This tailored approach allows us to design kinase targeting drugs that aim to maximize the therapeutic benefit for cancer patients.
