**FarmTree is a social enterprise advancing landscape restoration through digital tools.**

Our FarmTree Tool enables users to create projections of agroforestry outcomes, evaluating carbon capture, environmental benefits, and financial returns in a few clicks. We support project leaders, farmers organisations, and investors worldwide.

> "The FarmTree Tool and team helped us understand the value of different
> agroforestry systems and the potential for increased revenue over a 30-year
> period"

> " _With the FarmTree Tool, we could demonstrate the impact of natural pest control on Oil Palm yields. Our corporate client was impressed, and awarded us a follow-up project!"_

> ""The FarmTree Tool generates context-specific scenarios for income, labour, inputs required - very versatile."
>
> **-Food Security and Resilience Advisor**

> "We found the FarmTree Tool essential for predicting outcomes of highly complexes farm scenarios, among many, also agroforestry systems."
>
> **-Lorenzo Mento, Agronomist, Nectaerra**

> "We know very little of agroforestry options for a particular local context. The FarmTree tool is super helpful to generate location-specific scenarios!"

> "FarmTree is the first and only service that makes science-based agroforestry projections at scale: water, carbon, biomass, even cost and revenue, they do everything!"

> "We really valued the collaboration with FarmTree. We found the team and Tool very easy to work with and amenable to changes."

> "The FarmTree Tool is a reliable instrument which can assist the farmer during critical management decisions."

### Carbon sequestration for Rabobank ACORN

```
Acorn Rabobank
Asia, Africa and Latin America
```

​The Rabobank Acorn project requires single-species carbon sequestration projections for smallholder agroforestry business case development. FarmTree developed a protocol to project the biomass of individual species - even if they are poorly documented - and calibrate those with field-verified data by Acorn partners.

### Watershed reforestation in Morogoro, Tanzania

```
NWB Fonds
Tanzania

```

For the conservation and restoration of the Mindu dam catchment in Morogoro, Tanzania, agroforestry has been identified as an important nature-based solution. The NWB Fonds Watershed Reforestation Tool, powered by the FarmTree tool, is being used for decision support to identify agroforestry options and to catalyse climate action.

### Advancing agroforestry for smallholder coffee farmers in Ethiopia

```
Kyeema Foundation
Ethiopia
```

In the Ethiopian coffee system, the FarmTree Tool is proving useful in supporting the adoption and scaling of agroforestry practices, with a focus on enhancing farmers' income and biodiversity. With collaboration from Kyeema Foundation and Moyee, a Dutch coffee company, the project is working on extending to benefit multiple coffee areas.
