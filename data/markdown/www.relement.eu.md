Adding the R element.

Converting sustainable feedstocks into high performing chemical ingredients

for coatings, adhesives, materials and more.

# RELEMENT IS ON A MISSION TO CHANGE THE WORLD OF AROMATIC CHEMICALS

Relement is a Dutch frontrunner in the emerging industry of renewable chemistry. We create unique and valuable chemical performance ingredients (aromatics) by converting non-food biobased raw materials. This results in better aromatics, better end-products and above all: a better world.

Virtually everything we use, wear, touch, drive, is made by the chemical industry. Aromatics provide crucial product performance such as gloss, scratch resistance and stability. Today’s aromatics are made from fossil feedstocks.

Biobased aromatics are the missing renewable element for many difficult-to-recycle products such as coatings, adhesives, materials and more. Our products provide an unmatched combination of improved performance and sustainability.

All elements matter.

Not only greener.

Our aromatics are the better solution.

For product performance and future.
