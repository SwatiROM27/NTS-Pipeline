### Transactions

**Direct insight into your customers' banking transactions.**

Bank transactions show the actual financial situation of a customer. Net income, fixed costs, spending patterns, life events and much more. The transactions are standardized and ready to use. With the improved insight you give your customer an even better experience.

![Transactions](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9z6zxnnw/production/4da05167e17e1229381b23e952cd86d7e1b47259-1177x890.png?w=1000&q=95&fit=max&auto=format)

### Data enrichment

**More insight thanks to categorized transaction data.**

After retrieving the transactions, they are automatically assigned the correct category. Think of salary, utilities, insurance, taxes, etc. This provides even more insight and makes the data easier to analyze and use in reports.

![Data enrichment](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9z6zxnnw/production/e22187b5d1a87dbe88f31d24fda6f01088df3b9a-1353x618.png?w=1000&q=95&fit=max&auto=format)

### Income check

**The actual net disposable income on a silver platter.**

No more digging through documents, but immediate access to the net disposable income, including any other sources of income. Verified transaction information speeds up the application process. Bank transactions are the key to the actual truth behind the paper truth.

![Income check](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9z6zxnnw/production/41e20f1debb0d7deda0d32775c4bd0fbd04669b9-1314x1016.png?w=1000&q=95&fit=max&auto=format)

### Expense check

**Fixed costs, leisure activities, credits, student debts and more thanks to the expenditure check.**

No matter how high your income is, irresponsible spending patterns still pose a risk. Insight into (monthly) expenses can help consumers manage their budget, help credit companies make better choices, provide fixed costs to suppliers proactive savings advice and more.

![Expense check](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9z6zxnnw/production/e27304966f5678888fdd799eb891b2079d8ef357-1272x903.png?w=1000&q=95&fit=max&auto=format)

### Pattern recognition

**Discover recurring costs and recurring income in an accessible way.**

A pattern exists if comparable amounts are credited or debited from the same account number at comparable times. Thanks to pattern recognition, we automatically filter out recurring transactions and present them in a clear diagram.

![Pattern recognition](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/9z6zxnnw/production/ae7fae1bffdc9a131b0dbc393a58e19e21e0ecd7-1193x722.png?w=1000&q=95&fit=max&auto=format)

### Risk analysis

**Assess an applicant's repayment capacity and even willingness to repay as agreed.**

Bank transactions provide quick insight into the actual financial scope an applicant has to repay a loan. Transactions also show important indicators to measure willingness to pay. How many refunds are there? Are there transactions from bailiffs' offices? Are periodic invoices paid on time or always late? Better insight into the applicant's financial resources and behavior allows a better assessment of creditworthiness.
