# Discover   our photonic quantum technology

Photonic-based quantum computing

QuiX Quantum’s photonic quantum computer uses particles of light (photons) as information carriers. It manipulates their quantum properties to encode computational problems for end users. The advantages of photonics as a quantum computing technology are: room-temperature operation, scalability, and a high degree of technology maturity due to the technology overlap with existing classical photonics applications.

Our photonic quantum computer consists of 3 parts: **Sources**, which generate the input quantum light; **Quantum Photonic Processor**, which manipulates quantum light and where the computation takes place; **Detectors**, which read out the result of this computation.

The core technology is based on our commercially available, award-winning, and market-leading photonics technology. This is used in our [Quantum Photonic Processors](https://www.quixquantum.com/products/quantum-photonic-processor), positioning QuiX Quantum as a leader among photonic quantum computing companies, with our unique combination of lowest losses and largest scalability.
