SenseGlove is a key tool for interaction. Without haptics you would simply have a walk through scene, and would rely heavily on visual and auditory cues alone.

Using regular controllers in VR is an artificial way of interaction, nobody ever pushes the button with their fist. Grabbing things, moving things needs to be as natural as possible.
