# Tiny technology,  for a sustainable future

Medspray contributes to a sustainable world by developing innovative spray nozzles for user-friendly health and physical care products. By making propellants redundant and increasing the user-friendliness, Medspray offers added value to both its clients and their end users.

The Medspray nozzles can be used for various purposes, especially where a slow-moving soft spray is required. We can create that soft spray without the use of liquid propellants. Thanks to our high-tech nozzle chips, sprays can be tailored to suit any application.

## Our family

[![](https://medspray.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/logo-resyca.svg)](https://resyca.com/)

Medspray and Recipharm have bundled forces in a joint venture named Resyca, which is developing soft mist inhalers based on pre-filled syringes and Medspray’s nozzle technology. As part of the Recipharm group, Resyca is offering a unique full service to pharma and biologic customers, allowing them to focus on the clinical trials by leaving all the CMC, device, fill and finish aspects to Resyca.

Medspray Anesthesia is the legal manufacturer and supplier of the Trachospray, a microdroplet spray device for applying medication to the upper airways of a patient. The Trachospray is convenient to both the user and the patient. Trachospray has CE and is available to medical professionals within the EU. For more information, see [Trachospray.com](https://trachospray.com/)

### [TRACHOSPRAY](https://trachospray.com/)

Convenient and effective

## Say no,   to propellants

Medspray invented and manufactures innovative spray nozzles. With the Medspray nozzle technology, we create a fine mist without using fast evaporating propellants or excipients. A simple pump with a water-based formulation is all it takes to generate a fine mist, for example for inhalation purposes, fine fragrances or personal care applications.

* * *

### FINE MIST, SLOW-MOVING

The soft mist from the inhaler travels to the lungs without depositing in the mouth and throat.

### LESS SIDE EFFECTS

Because the Medspray inhaler needs an overall lower dose to achieve the same dose reaching the lungs as existing products do, we create fewer side effects.
