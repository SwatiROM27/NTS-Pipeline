# **CD Leycom** provides PV Loop medical devices for real-time cardiac function and performance monitoring

In addition to volume, intra-cardiac pressure is recorded simultaneously to produce continuous real-time images, known as a **Pressure-Volume Loop (PV loop)** — widely recognized as a “gold standard” of cardiac function and performance.

PV loops provide insights on all aspects of heart function, which has proven to be _invaluable_ for cardiac research, clinical diagnoses, and improving the intra-operative experience for select cardiac interventions where comprehensive quantitative data is needed.

### **Clinical Applications** of **Pressure-Volume Loop (PV Loop) Analysis**

##### **[Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)](https://www.cdleycom.com/cardiac-resynchronization-therapy/)**

PV Loops are used for real-time clinical decision making for pacemaker optimization related to tailoring vector settings, AV delay, and/or lead placement to each patient.

##### **[Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)](https://www.cdleycom.com/systolic-diastolic-heart-failure/)**

PV loops are considered the “gold standard” for [HFpEF](https://www.cdleycom.com/diagnostic-utility-of-pressure-volume-loops-in-diastolic-heart-failure/) diagnosis by monitoring several diastolic hemodynamic variables including, but not limited to: End-diastolic [Pressure-Volume Relationship](https://www.cdleycom.com/pressure-volume-relationship-in-blood-vessels-insights-into-arterial-stiffness-and-its-impact-on-hypertension-and-cardiovascular-diseases/) (EDPVR), Tau, and dP/dt.

##### **[Mechanical Circulatory Support](https://www.cdleycom.com/mechanical-circulatory-support/)**

By using PV loops as a feedback mechanism, one can optimize a patient’s hemodynamic state resulting from acute or long-term mechanical circulatory support. Quantitative measures of ventricular energetics, diastolic function, and intra-ventricular dyssynchrony provide a comprehensive assessment of hemodynamic function tailored specifically to that patient.

##### **[Structural Heart Interventions](https://www.cdleycom.com/structural-heart-interventions/)**

PV loops can be used as a real-time feedback tool regarding the efficacy of any structural heart intervention. To date, most users have focused on improving the efficacy of valve deployment in TAVR/TAVI and TMVR interventions or valve improvement via mitral valve clipping or valvuloplasty procedures.
