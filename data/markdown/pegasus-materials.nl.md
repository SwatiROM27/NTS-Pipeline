# Leveraging Biology for Sustainable Performance Materials

Our way of life is enabled by performance materials that are used in any object around us. Given we are becoming more mobile and are driving more EV cars we see strong demand growth for these materials.

​

In order to continue to innovate in materials the industry not only has to deliver on the future higher technical requirements but also has to become more sustainable. The traditional materials industry is not capable to deliver on these needs.

​

Pegasus-Materials uniquely creates new performance materials that are more sustainable and can answer the unmet needs of these industries

We do this by deep customer and application understanding, leveraging biology and apply the SynBio toolbox with chemistry to innovate and provide solutions for a better future.

## Innovating for a Better Future

At Pegasus-Materials, we are committed to creating a better future through the development of sustainable performance materials. Our team of experts leverages biology to create innovative solutions that solve unmet needs. We are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible to make the world a better place.

### Materials that enable innovation in Electronics, 3D printing, Biomedical, Defense and Automotive.

Our materials are designed to meet the needs of the modern world, where technical performance and sustainability is a top priority. We create materials those have unique performance and enable innovation in electronics and many industries. These materials are reliable, and more sustainable, helping businesses meet their innovation goals while reducing their environmental impact.

#### Application   Understanding

#### Product   Design

#### Material Composition

### Materials designed with the application and supply chain in mind.

Manufacturing and the process of scaling are critical for our company and the customer. We will work with CMOs and partners to produce the right quality of product. We often start production with assets in place to proof product market fit - we will optimize later and typicially swap to bio monomers after the customer has signed of on our product performance.

### Materials that are based on customer needs for more sustainability and better performance

Our materials are designed with support of data science and analytics. The process ALWAYS starts with Understanding Customers express their unmet needs. We believe working with Customers of Today and Tomorrow creates joint success.  We start to engineer the materials by identifying the potential candidate monomers which are the building blocks for the polymers. Biology has a huge diversity and allows the use of new molecule structures. Machine Learning and AI can help to identify the perfect buildiing block offering the performance the customer wants.

### Putting Customers First

At Pegasus-Materials, we are committed to providing our customers with the best possible experience. Our team of experts is always available to answer your questions and help you find the right solution for your needs. We believe in building long-lasting relationships with our customers and putting their needs first. Innovation is a Partnership process.

#### Earth has a problem with our greenhouses gases, our water consumption, our waste,  and use of finite resources

#### Rethinking how we make materials will help our planet   do better.     Synthetic Biology provides a sustainable solution. Savings of 50-100% on CO2 emissions are completely reachable. Renewable resources are used and waste is eliminated - it is within reach.
