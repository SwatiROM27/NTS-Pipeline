[More affordable, larger scale, greater impact.](https://www.front-materials.com/scale-up/)

## Our Mission

Advancing the development, use and reuse of planet-friendly aesthetic building materials.

## Our new dimension

The world is changing fast, and so is the world of construction. Following the successful launches of the WasteBasedBrick in 2009, the BioBasedTile in 2022, and Cornwall in 2023, we are now ready to embark on a new journey into the next dimension.

With the same expert team, but under our new name, FRONT®, we will expand our collection with more innovative materials, aiming to make an even greater positive impact on the construction industry. FRONT®: Your partner for sustainable, aesthetic building materials.
