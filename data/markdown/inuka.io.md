“Inuka has been embraced by our colleagues. The great added value of Inuka coaching is that it is completely anonymous and strongly focused on evaluation, individual coaching, and continuous development. These elements are key to providing tailor-made solutions for individual needs. Every person is different, and **before discovering Inuka, we couldn’t find a single development and well-being solution that fit all our needs.”**

Karen StadaEuropean HR Director

"We decided to partner with Inuka coaching, to offer a coaching service, that our people can reach out to any moment in time, without having to ask for it first. Whether it is about **a mental problem, career growth, or a private situation, we find it valuable our staff gets immediate support** with these kind of situations."

"It has been very easy to introduce Inuka in our organisation and we were guided along the way by Inuka's team, with good uptake amongst our people. What I would like to emphasize is Inuka's power that **every employee is in charge of their own journey.** They can choose to do a scan or book a coach when, where and how they see fit without going to their manager or HR first."
