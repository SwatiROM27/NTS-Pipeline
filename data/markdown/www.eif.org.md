# Dutch Venture Initiative I (DVI-I)

DVI-I is a **EUR 202.5 million fund-of-funds initiative of the EIF and Oost NL**, supported by the **Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and** the **Brabantse Ontwikkelings Maatschappij (“BOM”)**, launched in 2013 to boost equity investments into innovative and/or high-tech early and development stage enterprises in the Netherlands.

DVI-I was greeted with high demand from the market, which has led to the full allocation of the resources available to the selected fund management companies and to the launch of [DVI-II](https://www.eif.org/what_we_do/resources/dvi-II/index.htm), the successor programme.

By the end of 2019, DVI-I had committed a total amount of EUR 148m to 13 different venture and growth capital investment funds, mobilising an amount of EUR 1.6bn available for SMEs. In addition, DVI-I invested EUR 45m in the European Angels Fund (EAF) Netherlands, bringing the overall DVI-I commitments to EUR 193m.

**For SMEs:**

If you are looking for funding, you can contact the funds in which DVI-I has invested, displayed at this page.

For information about finance available under further EU initiatives, please visit [http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/funding-grants/access-to-finance](http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/funding-grants/access-to-finance)

**_Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (SFDR):_**

_One of the primary objectives of the DVI programme was and is to support the innovation landscape in the Netherlands. By supporting Dutch-oriented venture and growth capital funds, DVI provides additional funding support to innovative and promising companies which are expected to drive future economic growth in the Netherlands. At the same time, DVI also wants to contribute to a better world with a good quality of life. Both for current and future generations._

_The Fund defines with the assistance of the Investment Advisor certain excluded sectors in which the Fund is prohibited to invest directly or indirectly The selection of such sectors is based on the Investment Advisor ESG guidelines: [EIF Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) Principles](https://www.eif.org/news_centre/publications/esg-principles.htm) as well as on investment considerations meant to avoid inter alia any actual or potential material social, governance and/or environmental negative impact  on the Fund performance. Such excluded sectors are taken into consideration in the investment process and decision-making process of the Fund._

_The Fund does not consider adverse impact of investment decisions on sustainability factors at the present time considering that (i) in the absence of regulatory guidance, it is not clear what regulators will expect of entities that elect to consider such matters at this time, and (ii) it is also not clear that there is sufficient data, and data of a sufficient quality, to support entities that do so, in the relevant asset classes, industries or sectors in which investments have been/may be made. Sustainability factors are environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters._
