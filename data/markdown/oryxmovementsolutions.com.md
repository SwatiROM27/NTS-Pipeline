# Better movement starts with understanding

At ORYX, we believe that understanding movement is impossible without data. This is why we develop solutions for movement professionals to help patients or athletes more effective and faster.

Yet true understanding goes beyond data alone. Our expertise lies in the translation of biomechanical data into instantly applicable information for purposeful treatment or training.

## Holistic analysis: examine across multiple layers

Movement is complex, made up of many interconnected layers, from subtle muscle actions to full-body patterns. To capture this complexity, our focus extends past conventional metrics like angles and ranges.

Our analysis framework enables you to delve into coordination dynamics and motor control, grounded in the dynamic systems theory. Examine motor control and variability within each layer to obtain valuable data without losing sight of the broader context.
