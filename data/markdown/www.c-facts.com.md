## **Cost** insights

### Ensure all your cloud costs are accounted for

With the C-Facts allocation of costs, you ensure that all costs are allocated to the correct cost centers. More importantly, you also get a clear overview of all unassigned costs.

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/geldboom@2x.png)

## **Business** insights

### Charge your customers and departments

C-Facts enables you to efficiently and accurately cross-charge your departments or create [pro forma billing](https://www.c-facts.com/cloud-billing-software/) for your customers by configuring overhead costs, margins and discounts.

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/team@2x.png)

## **Share** insights

### [FinOps from a single source](https://www.c-facts.com/cloud-cost-management/)

Give your customers, departments, and other relevant stakeholders access to your C-Facts Control Center – creating an always up to date single source of truth.

### Insights

## Cost allocation: the foundation of FinOps

Enabling budget holders to manage their cloud costs starts with allocating costs to cost centers.

This provides budget holders with a clear overview of the cloud costs they are responsible for.

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/assistent-doos-196x300.png)

### Cloud

## Cloud and Multi-Cloud insights

Whether you are using one Public Cloud with one subscription or multiple subscriptions in the same Public Cloud or have adopted a Multi-Cloud strategy:

C-Facts has you covered with a single pane of glass on cost and usage.

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/logos-horizontal-5.png)

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/C-Facts-Single-Cloud-multiple-accounts.png)

### Single Cloud, multiple accounts

Using one cloud doesn’t necessarily mean you have just one account or one type of account.

Let C-Facts connect to multiple accounts from the same public cloud provider, independent of the type of accounts you are using.

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/C-Facts-Multi-Cloud.png)

### Multi Cloud

Multi-Cloud has proven to be a viable option for many companies, but it does bring additional challenges to cloud cost management.

C-Facts simplifies this by connecting to an array of public clouds, providing a single view on multi-cloud costs.

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/C-Facts-On-Premises.png)

### On-premise infra

Do you have a sizeable on-premise infrastructure for which you need to track usage and costs?

Then have C-Facts create a custom collector to ensure automated, correct, daily collection of your on-premise cloud cost and usage data.

## Management Control Center as a Service

C-Facts is not just a tool but a service that does the heavy lifting for you by connecting to an array of Public Cloud API’s. We gather **daily usage- and licensing data** and convert them into a common data model that enables us to offer you that single pane of glass you’re looking for.

### Empower your stakeholders

You share your C-Facts Control Center with your stakeholders to let them gain insights. Empower them even more by enabling them to create their [dashboards to best suit their needs](https://www.c-facts.com/blogs/the-12-must-haves-for-your-cloud-cost-management-dashboard/). The data stays the same. The view and insights become stakeholder specific.

### There is more than Public Cloud

Our flexible and future-proof SaaS-solution can connect to any relevant API enabled system used by your company. We filter out the operational and technical noise and present you only the management insights you need to control and govern your business.

### Simplify your cloud cost management

C-Facts, [cloud cost management software](https://www.c-facts.com/cloud-cost-management-software/ "C-Facts Cloud cost management software") enables you to report on spending by cost center, have a clear central overview of non allocated Public Cloud costs and share this information with all your stakeholders. We replace the static PDF-based reports with an interactive Control Center that enables your stakeholders to get the cloud cost insights they need.

![](https://www.c-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/verrekijker@2x.png)

### Historical data from day one

A dashboard without historical data is of limited value. That is why when you add a new Public Cloud data source to your C-Facts Control Center we will automatically collect the available historic data. Are you using the manual upload of data via CSV? Don’t worry because that also provides the possibility to upload historical data.
