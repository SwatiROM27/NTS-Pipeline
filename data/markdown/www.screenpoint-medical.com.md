Screening mammography is an effective screening tool, but has limitations. Radiologist reading capacity, dense breast tissue, and shifting demographics can make those limitations daunting.

With Transpara, radiologists get:

Overcoming

Challenges with Transpara

[Untitled 2](https://screenpoint-medical.com/evidence#evidenceworkflow)

### [Improved workflow](https://screenpoint-medical.com/evidence\#evidenceworkflow)

regardless of acquisition type (FFDM, DBT) or reading environment
(single reading, double reading)

[Untitled 2](https://screenpoint-medical.com/evidence#evidenceconfidence)

### [Greater confidence](https://screenpoint-medical.com/evidence\#evidenceconfidence)

particularly in dense breast tissue - Transpara excels where mammography is hardest, in the half of women with denser breast tissue

[Untitled 2](https://screenpoint-medical.com/evidence#evidenceimages)

### [Image-based risk](https://screenpoint-medical.com/evidence\#evidenceimages)

enables both a proven-accurate snapshot of risk as well as the opportunity to track risk over time to find
red-flags in individual trends

### Unmatched clinical evidence

I use Transpara all the time, and won’t read another 3D mammogram without it. The product fits seamlessly into our workflow, and we have found over time it has increased our mammography workflow. Thanks to the technology’s score card we are also able to focus on those high risk patients first, and get those patients the care they may need faster.

Transpara increases my confidence and efficiency going through a screening mammography session. I have more focus especially with the higher risk cases thanks to their Intuitive Triage software.

We are now prospectively implementing Transpara in our screening program and we are very excited to see the results from our prospective trial. Even better, we have observed that the latest version of Transpara has significantly improved the detection performance of the system, and a higher sensitivity is achieved at high specificity.

We are at the forefront of one of the first prospective studies with Transpara. As we will implement Transpara in a real-life screening setting in Ostergotland County, we aim to improve the quality of the breast cancer screening program while at the same time safely reduce the workload of breast radiologists.

Transpara may allow discriminating studies, which require more attention and selection of those, which may be handled with single reading for example. It may thus contribute significantly to both risk adapted screening and optimum assignment of resources.

Transpara has the potential to detect specific cancers earlier. I can think of 1-2 recent cases with calcifications, where Transpara detected a cancer earlier that was not easily visible on a mammogram.

### Can you afford to wait?

1

#### Burnout and Shortages Threaten  Medical Diagnosis and Treatment

In the US, 1 in 5 radiologists reading mammography feel so burned out that they are ready to leave the field – professional departures are unlikely to improve burnout for the remainder of the profession. A 2016 Aunt Minnie report on the state of radiology in Europe called the radiology workforce situation in France a “ticking time bomb” and stated that a shortage of radiologists in the UK was causing delays in diagnosis and treatment.

#### Improving Capacity through Workflow Enhancements

Technology is always changing, and always demanding
an investment, so it can be tempting to wait. But with subscription software focused on improving capacity through workflow enhancements, why wait?

3

#### Continuous Advancements  & Enhanced Access

A Transpara subscription means annual algorithm updates, changes that enhance usability and functionality, and access to the latest innovations when the become available.
