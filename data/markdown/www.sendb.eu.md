Ensuring the right start for every crop by optimal seed placement, high germination rates, and improved establishment is crucial. S&dB’s unique **[Seed-Embedding Technology (SET)](https://www.sendb.eu/set-tech/)** concept aims to produce high crop yields by precision seed placement, efficient water management, and minimizing the need for agrochemicals. The potential impact of SET on agricultural productivity and sustainability, both CEA and open field cultivation, is profound. Our proprietary platform guarantees that a higher proportion of seeds successfully grow into healthy plants.

Our in-house developed, patented technology combines plant seeds with cost-efficient bio-based materials to support and protect early plant growth. This ensures better control over weeds and diseases. Also, it provides an environment that fosters seed germination and establishment of seedlings more so than soil alone. Our vSET, cultivation method for open field, creates unique opportunities for regenerative farming!

# Creating    real impact

on sustainable agriculture.

The impact of S&dB's SET platform technology on agricultural productivity cannot be overstated. S&dB has developed a proprietary plant Seed-Embedding Technology (SET) to guarantee an optimal germination environment for the whole seed spectrum.

Our SET platform technology reduces the effect of nature’s bio-stresses, boosts the seed vigor and guarantees uniform growing crops with a strong root foundation, even under challenging environmental conditions.

SET is a sustainable, green and user friendly technology that can be applied for various concepts and is easily scalable.
