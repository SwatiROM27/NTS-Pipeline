**OLED device modeling**

Bumblebee is a simulation tool used to model the long-term behavior of OLED materials by tracking the diffusion of carriers, molecular emissions and device degradation over time. It helps researchers understand how defects form, how materials age, and how charge carriers move within OLED layers, crucial for improving device efficiency and lifespan.

**OLED device modeling far beyond the 1D drift-diffusion model:**

- Account for nanostructures in the stack, including filementary transport, bulk heterojunctions, dye-sensitiser interactions, polymer alignment and dopants
- Amorphous disorder yields variations in molecular properties such as energetic DOS and transition dipole alignment
- Explicit electrostatic interactions between molecules (including long-range components)
- Model the distribution, transfer and trapping of excitons between host and guest molecules
- Transient response simulations, small-signal analysis and pulsing experiments

[Application Examples](https://www.scm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SCM010-A4-Bumblebee-final.pdf)

- Model state-of-the-art OLED materials including TADF emitters and hyperfluorescence
- Locate processes in your stack thanks to explicit morphologies and time-evolution
- Model host-guest distributions, layer interfaces, dopant gradients, polymer networks and other complex structures
- Include complex opto-electronic processes: exciton annihilation, polaron quenching, triplet harvesting, exciplexes, vibronic coupling and more
- Include molecular disorder and long-range electrostatic interactions
- Optical outcoupling for light management
- New algorithms reduce computational cost by a factor 10-50 compared to standard kinetic Monte Carlo implementations
- Optimise your stack with built-in parameter screening and optimisation tools

**First-principles OLED device simulations in combination with AMS**

- Generate a realistic thin film structure via simulated physical vapor deposition
- Calculate the distribution of properties such as ionization potential, electron affinity and dipole moments for all molecules in the film
- Load properties into Bumblebee for OLED device simulations
