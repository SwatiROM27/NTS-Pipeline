# **Cellcius halts business activities**

Cellcius, a spin-off of TNO and TU Eindhoven, will be terminated as of March 1. Currently, the heat battery technology developed by Cellcius is not efficient enough for a viable economic business case within the current market.

**Heat Battery**

The salt and water-based heat battery is a form of thermochemical energy storage. This technology allows heat to be stored in salt and then released through a thermochemical reaction. This makes it potentially a very important technology for energy transition. Storage is also an essential link in the energy transition with the imbalance in supply and demand still continuing for decades.

**Business case**

It is challenging to apply that process profitably in practice on a large scale, such as in streets and neighborhoods. In recent years, research has been conducted by Cellcius to find a financially viable business case for the heat battery with sufficient market size. Although the technology works extremely well, the conclusion is that a product that is more efficient and cheaper than current market alternatives cannot be brought to market in the short term. Due to the lack of this commercial prospect, Cellcius has decided, in consultation with its shareholders, to cease business operations. Over the past month, Cellcius has successfully entered into discussions with grantors and creditors to reach an agreement on outstanding loans and settle all matters.

**Enormously grateful**

Cellcius CEO Mascha Sanders: "After years of hard and enthusiastic work on the heat battery, we have unfortunately had to draw the conclusion that the technology cannot currently be sufficiently commercialized. We deeply regret this. Not only for ourselves, but especially for the many parties and individuals who have given their support and cooperation to us and the development of our heat battery technology. We are enormously grateful to everyone for their trust and cooperation."
