## What we do

We empower organizations to turn technological disruption into sustainable transformation by blending technology with software, data, intelligence and processes.

### Engineering

Our engineers are loaded with education, hands-on experiences, prefab solutions, code fragments, cloud foundations, software engineering, data-engineering, data science, best practices, knowledge of OSS and commercial IT and accelerators.

### Accelerators

We can help you build your own platform and pipeline from scratch or give you a head start and run your use cases on our pre-built and ready-to-go accelerators. Our accelerators are complete, "fit-to-purpose" systems built to reduce project time, code, pipeline and project costs by up to 80%

### Human-in-the-loop

We are strong in technology, software engineering and data engineering – but we know that the human in the loop is a crucial element.


## Engineering

We have a large team of experts in software and data engineering and we think we are the best in data platforms and intelligent automation. We build and operate them for many of our customers, such as Nestlé, Hunter Amenities, Radisson Blu, Rijkswaterstaat, Marriot, and many others.

We blend onshore engineering with nearshoring. Having engineers onshore or on site adds value to our customers as they can collaborate more easily, trouble shoot more efficiently and work on strategic initiatives more effectively when they are working face to face. And the cost differential of nearshoring makes a real difference.

## Accelerators

Our accelerators are complete, “fit-to-purpose” systems built to reduce project time, code, pipeline and project costs by up to 80%.

We built our accelerators with the composable enterprise in mind, enabling our customers to transition from IT and project–centric to a business and product-centric setup. Business users and business leaders work together with IT, developers and analysts to build the best technology, applications and data products that align with business goals.

## Curious what we can do?

> **>**When we commit to a customer, our promise is to accelerate sustainable transformation and value generation. We put our experts in the lead and they work close together with the experts of our customers, from start to finish.

##### Legacy modernization

We migrate legacy tech to the cloud using modern architecture, infrastructure, custom code and intelligent automated processes.

##### Platform engineering

We can engineer a custom platform from scretch or deploy our accelerators to turn your use cases and ideas into scalable, intelligent, products.

##### DataOps & Science

We apply ML and AI to datasets and automate data pipelines that incorporate changes continuously. Enabling automatic respond to requests for changes with unimaginable speed

## Optimize costs with our accelerators

> _**>** We remove the need to own, run, and manage the lifecycle of the data & compute infrastructure.With guaranteed savings at scale._
>
> _**>** There are no upfront expenses. Each accelerator is full featured, and we charge for only the tenant and the data center resources needed, assessed during a **free Proof of Value**._

## Accelerator use cases

**The “designed-In” features leverage our accelerators for very different cases.**

## Influencing driver behaviour

Influence the choice of drivers taking the main lane or the corridor and allowing smooth lane changes. Influencing between the lanes within the lane, and change lanes at the correct spot. For example, lane changes can be optimised, capacity can be optimally utilized and braking movements can be reduced just before the lanes split, which benefits traffic flow.
