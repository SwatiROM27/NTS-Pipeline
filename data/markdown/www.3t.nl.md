The Sirius Pintuition System presents an innovative solution for breast cancer surgery. The procedure involves the insertion of a tiny titanium-encased magnet into the tumor using a needle. To assist the surgeon further, a specialized rod is introduced through a small incision in the breast. This rod detects the magnetic field and offers valuable guidance during the surgical process. Notably, this innovative approach enhances cosmetic outcomes and facilitates more breast-conserving surgeries.\\
\\
Throughout the system's development, 3T spearheaded the electronic aspects, addressing challenges in accurately detecting and interpreting the magnetic field. Collaborating with a third-party provider, we devised sophisticated mathematical algorithms for precise positioning.\\
\\
As a result, the device's screen now provides real-time information, displaying the distance between the rod and the magnetic seed in millimeters, proving to be a vital asset during surgery.\\

The digital controller for a diesel Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) serves as an exemplary illustration of a complex embedded system with stringent real-time requirements. It meticulously monitors and analyzes over 100 input parameters, including frequency, voltages, currents, and their phase differentials. This data is indispensable for detecting power failures and regulating the speed of the diesel engine. Moreover, the controller seamlessly communicates with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) through Modbus TCP, overseeing the entire UPS control system.

A standout feature is its extensive logging capability, which records all inputs, outputs, and control signals. These logs can be accessed through the Ethernet interface, proving invaluable for analyzing and diagnosing issues in our customer's installation.

Additionally, the controller's ability to assess the quality of the utility voltage using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) adds another indispensable dimension to the UPS system's functionality.

![](https://www.kendrion.com/fileadmin/_processed_/f/a/csm_Pyranometer_001_klein-1024x682_8c687142bd.png)

A pyranometer, also known as a solar irradiation sensor, is a precise instrument used to measure the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface. Originally designed for meteorological purposes and used by operators with a thorough background in analog measurement and calibration techniques, the growing demand from the PV market prompted the need for a user-friendly, plug-and-play sensor that could seamlessly integrate into digital networks within minutes.

Given that the sensor essentially functions as a precision temperature sensor, any nearby heat dissipation could introduce errors. To address this challenge, we've developed an exceptionally low-power interface that ensures the accuracy needed for our clients' entire product range, including their top-tier meters.

![](https://www.kendrion.com/fileadmin/_processed_/c/7/csm_radar-speed-control-SensysGatso_149e3f6c22.jpg)

In collaboration with our customer, we've developed a high-performance radar back-end module. This module controls the radar front-end module, which generates and receives the analog tracking signals. The radar back-end module, powered by the Xilinx Zynq Z-7020, incorporates signal conditioning, data acquisition, and data processing for analog radar tracking signals. Digital Signal Processing on the Zynq FPGA fabric enhances processing capabilities, while the eCos RTOS on a Zynq ARM core ensures precise timing for radar tracking tasks. The required tracking algorithms are developed through Model-Driven Development using MATLAB and Simulink. This integrated solution represents a significant advancement in radar signal processing and tracking technology.

Surgical booms demand an optimal level of flexibility and user-friendliness to grant the surgical team swift access to critical functions. To facilitate seamless control of the operating unit, there is an intelligent braking system, with 3T responsible for the electronics and software.

The primary challenge lay in crafting software that seamlessly integrated into a complex system, with a significant portion of the mechanical design yet to be finalized. By embracing the Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach, our team effectively modeled and simulated the system's interfaces and behavior, , allowing for precise development tailored to the customer's requirements.

We achieved an ideal solution by actively involving the customer in the development iterations and software optimizations. This collaborative approach ensured that the surgical booms met the highest performance and usability standards.

Development through cooperation

We are convinced that co-development is the way to success. By working together, we create a long-term partnership based on transparency and trust.

We embrace a project-based approach to our development activities. We do our projects according to our development process. If desired, we can also develop according to the client's development process.

We understand that intellectual property is important to our clients, so we offer them the option to own the IP of their projects.

From prototype to volume production

We offer qualified supply services spanning functional prototypes to volume production with inspection and quality control. Our team provides expertise in new product introduction, including design for manufacturability, design for testing, and supply chain management.

We have our own qualified EMS partners. If desired and quality matches, we can also manufacture at a client-preferred EMS partner.

Maintaining the product during the life cycle

Once a product is developed and produced, our team can still drive product innovation, life cycle management, cost optimization, knowledge retention, and failure analysis.

We help our clients identify areas for improvement, reduce costs while maintaining quality, retain knowledge, and improve product performance and reliability.
