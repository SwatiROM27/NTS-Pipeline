## What is Sepsis

Sepsis is a serious medical condition characterized as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by an infection. In case of sepsis and septic shock, additional complications occur including acute organ dysfunction and persistent reduced blood pressure. Sepsis and septic shock are leading causes of death and present a major clinical problem in the management of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
