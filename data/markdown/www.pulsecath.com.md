#### What they say

## Testimonials

I was happy to use iVAC 2L during this high-risk procedure; patient has a 15% EF. The system gave the right support, is very user-friendly and much more easy to use in comparison with Impella CP.

Dr. Amer Al Karme

Al Khalidi hospital in Amman

Jordan

This technology gives us better blood pressure support for very sick hearts while performing complex interventions. It allows us to perform these procedures more safely with better clinical outcomes for the patient and less stress for our team.

Dr. Madhav Menon

Waikato hospital in Hamilton

New Zealand

Patient was hemodynamic stable during the procedure and we couldn‚Äôt treat him without support.

Prof. Ramunas Unikas

Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas

Lithuania

iVAC 2L system is very easy to use.

Dr. Igor Balevski

UMC Maribor

Slovenia

Another life saved in Malta, Mater Dei Hospital, ¬†thanks to successful PulseCath iVAC 2L MC support during haemodynamically unstable VT Ablation to treat refractory VT.

Dr. Matthew Marcieca Balbi

Mater Dei Hospital

Malta

Patient was hemodynamic stable during the CTO LAD procedure; positioning of the IVAC 2L succeeded without any major problems and the closure after the procedure went very well.

Dr. Gioel Gabrio Secco

Ospedale Civile Ss. Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo

Italy

We performed complex percutaneous revascularization in an old patient with 3-vessel disease and iVAC 2L helped us maintain stable circulation throughout the duration of this procedure.

Dr. Antan Farkas

Kardiocentrum Agel

Slovakia

The support of iVAC 2L was lifesaving during this challenging CTO intervention.

Dr. Jurij Avramovic Gregoric

Hospital Izola

Slovenia

High-Risk and Indicated (CHIP) PCI case with EF 30%. Unprotected LM and 3-vessel disease.

The patient was hemodynamically stable during the PCI, especially when performing Balloon Angioplasty to LM.

Dr. Chan Yu Ho

CUHK Medical Centre

Hong Kong

iVAC 2L provides a better support, increases cardiac output and gives us more time in terms of performing long high risk PCI procedures. In this case the patient was refused for surgery.

Dr. Azmee Mohd Ghazi

National Heart Institute, IJN

Malaysia

During the complex CTO the iVAC 2L system helped to stabilize the hemodynamics during the critical parts.

Dr. Alexander Nap

Amsterdam UMC

Netherlands

We really saw the support of iVAC 2l and it helped us to treat the complex lesions which would be much more difficult and dangerous to treat it without the support. Patient had very fragile vessels and it was much more safer to do the procedure with the support of iVAC 2L.

Prof. Andrejs Erglis

Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital

Latvia

During inflation the pressure still remaining high, operator very satisfied, no stress for the team, patient was hemodynamic stable during the procedure.

Dr. Martin Hudec

Banska Bystrica Hospital

Slovakia

Because of the use of the Shockwave IVL Sytem, it was necessary to have a percutaneous MCS system. The support of iVAC 2L was very good.

Dr. Daan Cottens

ZOL Genk

Belgium

Because of the great support by iVAC 2L we were able to perform a longer procedure without interruptions. The patient was hemodynamic stable during the procedure.

Dr. Jogen Patrk

GH Zadar

Croatia

I was happy to use iVAC 2l in this case of severe impaired LV function with totally occluded LAD and collaterals from the RCA that could be used and may lead to ischemia; having hemodynamic support with iVAC 2L has helped to overcome this limitation.

Prof. Mohaned Egred

Freeman Hospital, Newcastle

United Kingdom
