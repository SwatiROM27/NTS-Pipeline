## What is Spatial ALD Technology?

**Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition** (Spatial ALD) delivers a form-following high-quality coating at the atomic level. Compared with conventional ALD, this ingenious technology stacks atomic layers many times faster.

**Highest throughput and coating performance** at the **lowest costs** are the key added values Spatial ALD brings. Our in-depth expertise in Spatial ALD technology, combined with our unique ability to swiftly transfer your application from lab to fab, offers you exciting and groundbreaking opportunities in today’s growth markets.

### The differences

## Temporal ALD vs Spatial ALD

### Temporal ALD

- High-quality 3D layers and suitable for porous substrates.

- Limited deposition speed
- Parasitic backside deposition
- Batch process
- Vacuum chamber and pumps needed
- High cost per substrate

### Spatial ALD

- High-quality 3D layers and suitable for porous substrates.
- 100-300 times faster deposition speed by our spatial technology in combination with plasma enhanced deposition
- Continuous S2S and R2R process
- Atmospheric pressure deposition
- Scalable to large areas & flexible substrates
- Industrially proven, cost-efficient mass production.
