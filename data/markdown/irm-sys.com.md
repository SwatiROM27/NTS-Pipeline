### **EMERGENCY PIPELINE REPAIR SYSTEM**

**_Having repair clamps and tooling available alone is not sufficient._**

An Emergency Pipeline Repair System (EPRS) is a fundamental part of any Pipeline Integrity Management System. It is intended to sufficiently prepare for- and mitigate against the consequences of unplanned incidents breaching the pipelinesâ€™ integrity. Such breach causes downtime, could cause damages to people and the environment and in any case has financial implications in direct costs for repair, and indirectly in loss of revenue.

**_IRM Systems develops Emergency Pipeline Repair Systems for pipeline operators all over the world and always based on the Best Possible Technical Solutions against the Lowest Costs_**

### **AGEING PIPELINE ENGINEERING & ANALYTICS**

**_Extending a pipelineâ€™s lifetime while safeguarding integrity?_**

Especially in todayâ€™s challenging market conditions, pipeline operators are scrutinising and minimising operational expenditure while in the meantime also further stretching their assetsâ€™ operational envelope. Operators recognise that this poses a strain on their assetsâ€™ integrity and see the need to mitigate any possible risks resulting from this conflict.

**With an excellent understanding of the entire life cycle of an asset IRM Systems can advise and support remaining life time predictions, required (amended) IRM activities and/or any changes to the assetâ€™s operational envelope.**

## **Independent & hands-on integrated IRM works delivery**

### **IRM PROJECTS & FIELD SERVICES**

In a proper asset design all aspects of Inspection, Repair & Maintenance have been taken into account in order to optimise future operations for the operator in terms of safety, reliability and cost.

Often these aspects have not been properly considered due to which standard IRM solutions are inadequate or even impossible to use. Being independent from equipment- or technology providers and based on our extensive hands-on field experience, IRM Systems has proven its added value by providing solutions for any situation, especially when others give up. Depending on the situation retrofit modifications can be designed, approved and applied.

**Smart thinking out of the box, saving money.**
