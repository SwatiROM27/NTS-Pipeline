### THIS REPRESENTS 1.3 BILLION TONS OF FOOD, OF WHICH 14% COMES FROM THE FOOD SERVICE MARKET (CATERING, HOTELS, RESTAURANTS)

1 Kilo of wasted food equals:

### 4.5 KG OF CO2

If food waste was a country, it would be one of the most polluting in the world. Wasting 1 kg of food also means wasting many natural resources (planting, growing, processing, packaging and transporting).

1 Kilo of wasted food equals:

### 7000 LITERS OF WATER

Or the equivalent of 120 showers. Agriculture is already the world’s biggest user of freshwater. So imagine all the water wasted in growing the food that never reaches our plate.

1 Kilo of wasted food equals:

### €7 WORTH

Wasted food is wasted money. One kilogram of food waste equals on average 7 euros being wasted, based on the average market food cost.
