The basic requirements for optimal fracture healing are repositioning of the fracture, providing stability and compression and preservation of blood supply. The femoral neck fracture is vulnerable; fixation yields high re-interventions rates, up to 33%1,2. The small volume Gannet fixation system offers optimal stability for the femoral neck fracture, thus creating optimal conditions for primary bone healing and (re-) vascularization, resulting into significantly lower re-intervention rates.

#### **Dynamic compression**

##### **Dynamic compression stimulates bone fusion**

- ##### The Gannet Blade may slide within the plate when required

- ##### Dynamic compression stimulates bony fusion

- ##### Dynamic compression is essential for femoral neck fractures


#### **Tap-in technique**

##### **The Gannet implant is tapped in – not screwed**

- ##### Gannet is tapped rather than screwed into the femoral head

- ##### The femoral head should not rotate after repositioning

- ##### Tapping in helps to preserve the repositioning obtained during surgery


#### **Fixation strength**

##### **Deep anchoring in subchondral bone enhances fixation strength**

- ##### Gannet is positioned deep into the subchondral bone of the femoral head

- ##### Subchondral bone is more dense and stronger than femoral cancellous bone

- ##### Deep subchondral positioning helps increase fixation strength


#### **Highly stable**

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27434%27%20height%3D%27214%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20434%20214%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27434%27%20height%3D%27214%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

##### **Large, horizontal surface provides very stable support of the femoral head.**

- ##### The Gannet Blade has a flat, large, horizontal surface

- ##### Such surface helps reduce chances on subsidence

- ##### A flat, large, horizontal surface largely contributes to the superior mechanical stability of Gannet


#### **Superior rotation stability**

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27431%27%20height%3D%27214%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20431%20214%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27431%27%20height%3D%27214%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

##### **Expandable anchors & horizontal surface result in superior rotational stability.**

- ##### Gannet uses unique, expanding anchors for mechanical stability

- ##### Expanding anchors provide sound resistance against pull-out

- ##### Expanding anchors contribute to superior rotational stability


#### **For patients**

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27432%27%20height%3D%27214%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20432%20214%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27432%27%20height%3D%27214%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

##### **Low volume implant provides maximum space for bone and vascularization**

- ##### Gannet is a low volume implant when compared to round or screw-in implants

- ##### The use of flanges rather than round structures helps reducing implant volume while increasing load carrying capacity

- ##### Low volume means more space for bony structures
