# Jaundice Care for Zero Separation

## Jaundice Care for Zero Separation

## Jaundice Affects Millions of Newborns

Every **2.3 seconds**, a baby needs jaundice treatment—affecting **14 million newborns** each year. If left untreated, severe jaundice can lead to neurological damage. Current treatments often mean **separation, incubators, and stress for both babies and parents**.

Nurses struggle with **staff shortages**. And health systems spend **billions** treating jaundice inefficiently, even though these babies aren’t sick.

Bilihome began when Rick, our COO, could only watch his son Thijs, separated from is mum, and his twin sister. His story—along with countless others— continues fueling our mission of Zero Separation.

## We Created the New Standard of Care: Wearable Phototherapy

Bilihome’s patented **wearable phototherapy** integrates hospital-grade blue light therapy into a soft, organic cotton romper. **No incubators, no eye masks, no separation.** Parents can soothe, hold, feed, and bond with their newborns while effective treatment continues.
