##### Our Expertise and History

Biosynth's peptide expertise come from four companies who are now part of Biosynth - vivitide, Pepscan, Cambridge Research Biochemicals (CRB) and Pepceuticals - all four global leaders in custom peptides. Pepscan and vivitide joined Biosynth in 2022 which began the formation of Biosynth's Peptide division, with decades of expertise.

vivitide was formed from years of industry excellence from two leading US peptide companies, New England Peptide (founded 1998) and Peptides International (founded in 1983), and the experts there are well known for delivering the highest quality of products, and have manufacturing capabilities ranging from [mg](https://www.biosynth.com/peptides/custom-peptides) to [multi-kg](https://www.biosynth.com/peptides/peptide-manufacturing/multikilogram-large-scale).

Pepscan was a leading name in peptides for over 25 years the team is based in the Netherlands, with long standing industry leading knowledge in peptide lead discovery and optimization and leading manufacturing capabilities including GMP facilities.

Cambridge Research Biochemicals (CRB) joined Biosynth in 2023, adding both a UK Peptide production site and over 40 years of expertise in complex, labeled and difficult to make peptides.

Pepceuticals, another UK peptide production site, added in 2023, strengthened our global peptide offering for clinical trials and commercial supply. It brought the addition of a MRHA certified cGMP facility with multi-kilogram scale capabilities.

The Biosynth peptide team have world-leading unique expertise in complex peptide synthesis, between all of our peptide sites we can offer RGD peptides as well as manufacturing personalized peptides and high throughput production. We also have both lead discovery & optimization and GMP production, meaning we can offer a full end-to-end peptide service.

In addition we have a team that are highly skilled in peptide [antigen design](https://www.biosynth.com/biologics/custom-antibodies#phil), and [eptiope mapping](https://www.biosynth.com/biologics/epitope-mapping) to support your antibody projects as part of our [Biologics](https://www.biosynth.com/biologics) function, as well as our [custom antibody production services](https://www.biosynth.com/biologics/custom-antibodies).
