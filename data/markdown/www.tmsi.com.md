## EEG





Electroencephalography is a non-invasive technique that measures the electrical activity of the brain, providing insights into brain function and cognitive processes. Using electrodes on the scalp and an EEG amplifier, brain waves can be recorded and interpreted by a researcher or clinician. By understanding measurement techniques and being aware of common artifacts, such as mains interferences or physiological artifacts, an accurate EEG signal can be measured. This can be used for many different applications in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and more.

## HD-EMG





High-density electromyography is a non-invasive method that measures muscle activity's spatial and temporal patterns through EMG signals recorded on the skin's surface. HD-EMG signals offer valuable insights into muscular activation, making it useful for neuromuscular research. The spatiotemporal signals provide information about the regional activation of the muscles, including the magnitude and the size of the active region(s) of the muscle. Using decomposition methods, single motor unit activity can be extracted to represent the neural drive to the muscle. HD-EMG has various research applications, including rehabilitation, neuromuscular control, biomechanics, and signal processing.
