## Legal advice is everywhere. Now you can translate this into impact

# **Building a future-proof business with an operation and supply chain in sync with legislation!**

The management of companies in manufacturing, branding, retail, e-tail, and trade of non-food goods are dealing with a complex agenda. The pressure from stakeholders, investors, authorities, NGOs and end-users varies from growth and margins on the one hand to transparency, sustainability, and conformity on the other hand. And that whilst transportation is irregular in terms of schedules and price, consumer spending is low, and the regulatory tsunami from Brussels is significant. Add to this the complexity of the supply chain and the need for more legislative knowledge, and you have a puzzle that seems unsolvable.

This may result in stress due to constantly managing surprises, not meeting growth targets, unpredictable workload and cost, and disappointed shareholders. Recognise this?

What if there is a way to bring this back to normal proportions? A workflow that delegates the nitty-gritty work exactly where it should be in the supply chain. Built around an actionable comprehensive database, ensuring all necessary questions will be asked to the supply chain partners and answers validated. Changing it all again into one of the core activities of the commercial teams: managing supply chain performance. A process that will provide you with information enabling making the right business decisions.

# **That solution is called ProductIP.**

We ensure your team and supply chain partners get and stay in sync with the regulatory developments. We monitor developments in legislation around non-food consumer products in the EU/EEA and the UK and transform these into actionable elements within a web-based workflow. Today, this results in an average of 400+ updates monthly to our database and solution. A number likely to increase significantly, given the tsunami from Brussels:

•    General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR)

•    EU Deforestation-Free Products (EUDR)

•    Batteries and Waste Battery (BWBR)

•    Packaging and Packaging Waste (PPWR)

•    Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)

•    Digital Product Passport (DPP)

•    CSRD, CSDDD and other ESG/CSR initiatives

To name a few.

Thanks to our workflow, you can delegate work to your supply chain partners precisely where specialistic knowledge should be. After all, there was a reason you outsourced production to these partners, right?

The result? A comprehensive document trail that meets all legislative requirements, enabling you to demonstrate you are in control of product compliance and at the same time supports in collecting data for participation in mandatory schemes such as EPREL, SCIP, Digital Product Passport, Recycling schemes for packaging, batteries, electrical and electronic waste, and more. A future-proof operation capable of mitigating risks and ensuring actual stakeholder value. \*

Our automated and intelligent solution takes over the tasks of monitoring regulatory changes, updating spreadsheets, and sharing information.

To keep the added cost per article to a minimum, we run our operation using a one-to-many model.

•    Our software is web-based SaaS.

•    Our platform support is built-in, and the learning curve is steep.

•    We provide extensive regulatory explanations via ProductIPedia.com. Free.

•    Numerous Compliance Tuesday sessions a year act as "radar."

If you still have questions: don't worry; we will pick up the phone, and you will get an answer. It might be a referral to a specific expert or to participate in a paid event to increase knowledge, or the answer might be, "You better shouldn’t.”.

We do not have a legislative agenda, we are not a laboratory, inspection or certification organisation. We are not a market surveillance authority or an NGO. We are a truly independent source of reliable information.

From day one, we ensure that you, your team, and your supply chain partners get into a rhythm, as this is the only way forward when you want to create the necessary change. We have a roadmap, we have templates, we have the experience, we even have staff available would there be a need to outsource some work in the beginning?
