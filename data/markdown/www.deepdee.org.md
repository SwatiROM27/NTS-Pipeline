Scientific results behind Deepdee AI

We use proprietary modeling workflow and algorithms. AI core can be integrated into
clients’ systems with API, embedded in ophthalmic equipment or patients’ mobile device.

… and then, diagnose in less than 1 min with an average accuracy of 95%.

Projects

The Rotterdam eye hospital glaucoma AI retina screening.

The unique initiative with Rotterdam Eye Hospital & Glaucoma prof. Hans Lemij.

A dataset of 100,000 images will be collected and classified by professionals, with
a special attitude to quality control.

Retina screening by GPs.

The screening of the retina of diabetic
patients to detect diabetic could be much easier, faster and cheaper if
GPs could make use of a low cost and easy to use digital camera, service
platform and artificial intelligence based algorithms.
