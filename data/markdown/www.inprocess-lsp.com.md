## Key Applications for the NanoFlowSizer

### Lipid-based nanoparticles

[![Nano](https://www.inprocess-lsp.com/wp-content/uploads/LNP-application-liposome.jpg)](https://www.inprocess-lsp.com/lipid-based-nanoparticles/)

By enabling immediate process adjustments, the [NanoFlowSizer FIDES](https://www.inprocess-lsp.com/fides-product-page/) ensures that **LNP formulations** remain within critical quality parameters, reducing batch failures and increasing production efficiency.

[Learn about real-time LNP analysis…](https://www.inprocess-lsp.com/lipid-based-nanoparticles/)

### Low concentrated samples

[![Nano](https://www.inprocess-lsp.com/wp-content/uploads/protein-analysis-nanoparticles.jpg)](https://www.inprocess-lsp.com/app-note-continuous-inline-size-monitoring-low-turbidity-suspensions/)

Continuous Inline Size Monitoring **Low Turbidity Suspensions under Flow** in Biopharmaceutical Processes. Low concentrations and **sub-10 nm protein** measurement using the newly developed high-sensitivity [NanoFlowSizer THALIA](https://www.inprocess-lsp.com/thalia-nanoparticle-analyzer/).
