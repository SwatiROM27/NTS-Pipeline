Our technology

## Robust. Simple. Flexible.

As the world increasingly moves away from petrochemicals, our brand new technology demonstrates how a renewable raw material can be manufactured into vide spectra of future bio-based products. Goldilocks®, our green gold, originates in waste woody biomass or technical lignin. We mix it with a solvent, heat it, and out comes our green gold. This platform product can then be used for different applications – to make materials, various fuels, and fuel additives. We’re well on our way to producing a platform product with huge market potential, that is able to answer to the urgent need to transform our fossil-based economy to a more sustainable one. Let’s be the change.
