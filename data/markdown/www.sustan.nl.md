## Natural fibers for innovative change

Natural fibers are leading the way in a broader movement toward sustainable material innovation. These fibers offer a range of ecological benefits, thriving naturally in their environments. They play a crucial role in producing durable, environmentally friendly products that break down naturally over time.

As a result, natural fibers are essential in driving sustainable innovation across various industries, providing a renewable and environmentally friendly alternative that supports circularity and CO‚ÇÇ reduction.

## Enrichment of recycled plastics

Natural fibers are expertly combined with bio-recycled or biopolymer materials to achieve the ideal balance of modulus, stress, and strain, fully tailored to your specifications and needs. Engineered by our team of experts, these solutions deliver high-performance, sustainable products.

Proud to see our colleagues in action at [Berdal](https://www.linkedin.com/company/berdal-rubber-&-plastics-bv/)! [Martin Vr√∂sch](https://linkedin.com/in/martin-vr%C3%B6sch-204ba424/) and [Dinant van Putten](https://linkedin.com/in/dinant-van-putten-9028706/) successfully completed a trial using our Fibrus rPP 1020, producing a bucket that significantly reduces CO2 emissions.

üåç Op weg naar een duurzamere kunststofindustrie! üåç

Samen met [Martin Vr√∂sch](https://linkedin.com/in/martin-vr%C3%B6sch-204ba424/)had ik het genoegen om [Berdal](https://www.linkedin.com/company/berdal-rubber-&-plastics-bv/) te bezoeken, waar [Bas van Kamperdijk](https://linkedin.com/in/bas-van-kamperdijk-4773a613/)ons enthousiast ontving. Berdal zet grote stappen richting verduurzaming, en het is geweldig dat we vanuit [Sustan](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sustan/) daar actief aan kunnen bijdragen!

Tijdens ons bezoek hebben we een geslaagde proefspuiting uitgevoerd met onze Fibrus rPP 1020. Deze emmer op de foto heeft niet alleen een lager energieverbruik bij productie, maar bespaart ook nog eens 200g CO2 dankzij:

‚Ä¢ 20% natuurlijke vezels en gerecycled polypropyleen (PCM).

‚Ä¢ Lagere verwerkingstemperaturen, wat direct zorgt voor energiebesparing.

Bij [Sustan](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sustan/) geloven we in impact maken: üå± CO2-reductie dankzij natuurlijke vezels. üå± Duurzame en circulaire producten met minder milieu-impact. üå± Klanten helpen hun duurzaamheidsdoelen te halen, zonder concessies aan kwaliteit.

Dank aan Bas van Kamperdijk en zijn team voor hun inzet en samenwerking.

üå±Samen bouwen we aan een groenere toekomst!üå±

üåç Towards a more sustainable plastics industry! üåç

Today, Martin Vr√∂sch and I had the pleasure of visiting Berdal, where Bas van Kamperdijk gave us a warm welcome. Berdal demonstrates how companies are taking steps toward sustainability, and we at Sustan are proud to contribute!

During our visit, we conducted a successful trial molding with our Fibrus rPP 1020. The bucket in the photo saves an impressive 200g of CO2 thanks to:

‚Ä¢ 20% natural fibers and recycled polypropylene (PCM).

‚Ä¢ Production at lower processing temperatures, leading to energy consumption reduction.

At Sustan, we believe in making a tangible impact: üå± CO2-reduction through natural fibers. üå± Sustainable and circular products that reduce environmental impact. üå± Supporting companies in achieving their sustainability goals.

A big thank you to Bas and the Berdal team for their dedication and collaboration.

üå±Together, we‚Äôre building a greener future üå±

Successful production of biobased caps! ‚úÖ

With our Fibrus rPP 1020 compound, we have successfully produced caps through injection molding in collaboration with [Plastic Industrie "Utrecht"B.V.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/plastic-industrie-utrecht-b-v/)

The caps contain 20% natural fibers in recycled polypropylene and were produced at a lower processing temperature compared to virgin polypropylene, reducing energy consumption. Sustan guided the process to prevent issues such as burning and ensuring a smooth production. During this production the operators have been trained to work with our biobased and biodegradable compounds, contributing to a more sustainable plastics industry. üå±

Our R&D team in Maastricht has developed a unique material solution that once again raises the bar in the transition to circular production. This innovation provides a high-quality and fully sustainable alternative to conventional plastics‚Äî without compromising on quality or processability.

What makes this remarkable?

üå± Sustainable ‚Äì Maximally circular and designed with minimal CO2 impact.

üå± High performance ‚Äì Strong, versatile, and perfectly suited for industrial applications such as injection molding and extrusion.

This development underscores our mission to help industries transition to sustainable raw materials without compromise. Thanks to this breakthrough, we are strengthening our position as a pioneer in plastic-replacement materials.
