# Targeting the core of inflammatory disorders

Citryll is pioneering a transformative approach to treating immune-mediated inflammatory diseases by targeting Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), a fundamental component of the inflammatory processes that has yet to be addressed therapeutically.

## Targeting an unaddressed biology for treatment of immune mediated inflammatory disorders

Citryll is targeting NETs as a fundamental driver of inflammation in many immune mediated inflammatory diseases, with a focus on Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa as therapeutic development areas for CIT-013. Our lead asset, CIT-013, is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody with a unique dual mode of action. CIT-013 has demonstrated a powerful ability to inhibit NET formation and enhance NET clearance, addressing a key driver of inflammation.

### Clinical trial opportunities for patients

Citryll is conducting clinical trials for CIT-013, an investigational therapy developed to address Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). This clinical research seeks to understand CIT-013’s potential effectiveness, safety, and impact on patient quality of life. We expect two clinical trials to start by mid 2025.
