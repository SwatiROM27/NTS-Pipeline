## on graphite

## ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEMAND IS SOARING

Material supply chains struggle to keep up and the future of graphite sourcing remains uncertain.

In addition to upcoming shortages, graphite presents limitations in fast-charging and range performance.

While EV car makers zoom in on its enormous carbon footprint.

## CARBONX® \| POWERING THE FUTURE

We help counter graphite shortages by producing in carbon black plants world-wide, creating localized supply chains.

CarbonX’s 3D network structure can overcome the 2D limitations of graphite in batteries, boosting battery performance.

Our low-energy manufacturing process ensures reduced CO2 emissions.

## SUPPLY

High volumes, low cost. CarbonX proprietary feedstock technology can be applied to any carbon black manufacturing facility.

## BATTERY PERFORMANCE

Fast-charge, long range. CarbonX’s unique 3D carbon network structure improves Lithium-ion and electron transfer.

## SUSTAINABILITY

Lower CO2 emissions. A continuous and energy-efficient manufacturing process compared to natural and synthetic graphite.
