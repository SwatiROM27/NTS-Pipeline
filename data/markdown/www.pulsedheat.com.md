# Circular Technology

## Creating value out of water

Treatment of wastewater, drinking and process water, biosolids, sludge, and gasses

For municipal and industrial market

## Water Mining

Water mining is an innovative approach to wastewater management that involves extracting and treating wastewater directly from sewer systems to recover valuable resources such as reusable water, nutrients, cellulose, and energy.

This process not only alleviates the burden on centralized treatment infrastructure but also transforms extracted materials into high-value products, promoting a more sustainable and circular approach to urban resource management.

CirTec BV, a leader in Circular Technology, has been at the forefront of this field since 2010.

The transition to a circular and sustainable society
