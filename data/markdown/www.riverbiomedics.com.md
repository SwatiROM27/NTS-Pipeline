River BioMedics paves the way to the future of cardiac drug discovery

### Closer to the heart

We combine our cardiac biology knowhow with our expertise in bio-engineering and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to develop 3D cardiac in vitro models for the discovery and development of novel cardiac drugs.
