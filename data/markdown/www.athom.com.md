## Real-time insight into your energy usage.

## Save energy without changing habits.

With Homey’s detailed energy monitoring, you can save money on your electricity bill and live more sustainably in one go. Combine with Flow to automatically turn off all devices when the last person left the house.

##### Solar Panels

When you have solar panels, the outer ring shows their energy yield, relative to your home’s usage.

##### Smart Meter

When you have a smart meter, Homey calculates what you’re not measuring yet. Very useful to find all standby consumers.

### Measuring your energy usage.

#### Smart Plugs

Smart plugs measure any device’s energy usage by placing it between the power socket and the device. Smart plugs can be used for single devices or device groups.

#### Approximations

Homey knows in realtime when a device is turned on and off. When it also knows the device’s standby- and on-usage, Homey can approximate the energy usage through interpolation.

1

#### Your data is not our business.

We don’t sell data nor serve ads. Your data is yours. Always.

#### Intruders are kept outside.

Sandboxed Apps, Penetration Tests and Bug Bounties help ensure your home’s security.

## A Full House.   With Family Sharing.

### Users & Roles.

Assign family members and friends as manager, user or guest to determine who controls what — and when.

You can even create Flows to grant temporary access to guests — for example when you’re on holiday, or for a cleaner.

## Start Flows from anywhere. Anytime. Anyplace.

### Upgrade your voice assistant.

Voice assistants are great, but they can be limited. Connecting Homey lets you start Flows, and control many more devices.

Even at 125 units (and counting) it just works… and the ‘death star’ is even a centrepiece on my tv-shelf.
