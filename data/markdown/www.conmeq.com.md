## Engineering As A Service

From concept to reality, CONMEQ’s process is rooted in **Engineering As A Service (EAAS)**, providing clients with both flexibility and technical depth. Our team closely examines each part of the machine—from the structural elements to the power sources and battery systems—designing and refining these elements for maximum performance, safety, and efficiency. We prioritize efficient energy use, knowing that every component directly impacts the machine’s longevity and operational costs. We understand that a machine is more than a tool; it’s a trusted partner built to last.

## Efficiency & Creativity combined

### Conmeq AS15

From construction to paving; from demolition to trenching; from farming to fruit growers: the AS15 can carry max 500 kilo and can push max 700 kilo. Yet this attractive mini-loader fits through a standard door and is suitable for use on storey floors. The AS15 is easy to control, rotates effortlessly on its axis and protects against overload fully automatically.

### 7 Reasons why professionals choose AS15 Conmeq loaders

The AS15 Skidsteer represents the latest innovation in machinery by Conmeq, embodying the same design philosophy that has defined the company since its inception. These machines are meticulously engineered for maximum energy efficiency, ensuring optimal use of power and batteries. Efficiency is the cornerstone of our engineering process. We are conscious of energy consumption and have enhanced safety by providing real-time, clear feedback on display screens, letting users know when the machine is operating correctly. Our goal is for operators to feel in control intuitively, without the need for a manual. Even first-time users can feel confident, as simplicity in operation is achieved through sophisticated behind-the-scenes engineering. We believe that a seamless user experience is essential to the value our machines provide.

## At the forefront of the Net Zero transition

At CONMEQ, we recognize that achieving Net Zero across industries requires a collective shift in how we design and utilize machinery. We envision a future where **electric-powered, emission-free machines are the norm** rather than the exception. Our roadmap is ambitious: in the coming years, we aim to scale up production and expand our range of electric machinery to provide more solutions that support sustainable construction, agriculture, and industrial work. Each new product will be a step closer to a fully sustainable equipment market.

Sustainability goes beyond emissions; it’s woven into the very fabric of our products. Each machine is built from durable steel and engineered to last, providing a long operational lifespan to reduce the need for frequent replacements. This attention to longevity not only minimizes waste but also ensures that our machines are sustainable investments for our clients. For example, batteries are by far the most expensive part of any electric machine; if we’re not energy-efficient with our machines, that would mean that we’re wasting valuable resources. That’s why we clearly show the health of the battery in our displays, so the user can be sure that every machine is working as energy efficient as possible.  Additionally, with 99% recyclable parts, CONMEQ’s machines set a new standard in circular design, contributing to a reduced carbon footprint and reinforcing our commitment to a sustainable production lifecycle.

## Specialists in Innovation

At CONMEQ, quality is embedded in our DNA. We are committed to sourcing the best components available, understanding that robust, dependable parts lead to robust, dependable machines. Our goal is to deliver a machine that feels like a true ally—dependable, sustainable, and designed to perform optimally for years to come. With every machine we produce, we aim to set new standards in reliability, efficiency, and environmental responsibility, aligning with a future where cutting-edge technology meets sustainable practices.

In addition to blueprint engineering, CONMEQ has the capability to **bring ideas to life** through prototype creation in our in-house facility. Whether it’s looking for concept validation, limited-series production, or full-scale manufacturing, our team is equipped to set up and oversee each step of the production process, ensuring a seamless transition from prototype to production.
