### **Our BlueMarble world revolves around sustainable solutions and software. Are you future ready?**

The transition to e-mobility means a transition to sustainable, fossil-free energy. Going forward, this can contribute significantly to the Paris climate agreement. EV’s are a big part of this movement and they make us rethink the way we use public spaces and buildings and how to manage these spaces. Consequently operators in these sectors have new needs and demands concerning the shape of their management.

These new challenges require an integral vision and integral solutions, because the total energy demand of the underlying processes will undoubtedly be bigger than the available capacity. So we need smart systems that ensure the available resources meet the targets and interests of all parties concerned. BlueMarble Charging – in co-operation with visionary partners - is all about developing such a smart charging infrastructure and being a key player in the transition to e-mobility.
