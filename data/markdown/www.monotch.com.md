\[ 01 / about us \]

## We speak the ever-changing language of mobility

**We translate status into flow and traffic into progress. Every turn promises opportunities. Every corner allows movement. We keep moving because standing still is not in our vocabulary.**

We are always looking for new improvements, especially in the solutions we offer our customers. We break data silos and fluently speak the international data language of mobility. Allowing different objects, organisations, and individuals to exchange data is the essence of our business. We are the driver and the navigator in the dialogue of everything on, next to, and in control of the road—the architects and authors of moving forward.

### Extensive dashboarding and reporting

We provide powerful dashboards and insights for all stakeholders, as well as governed listener interfaces and metadata-export, so you can monitor performance, continue refining your policies, and drive important results.

> Everything dynamic is potentially a source of data you can connect to. The scale is unlimited, so long as it is standardised, and the data source owner is willing to share that with others.

Caspar de JongeSenior Executive Intelligent Transport Systems, Smart Mobility, Smart Cities ‐ Dutch Ministry for Infrastructure & Water Management

> With the largest C-ITS rollout in the world – Flanders and the Netherlands together – we have shown that it is possible. The implementation is live and scalable. The route has been explained, and the architectures are available.

Wim VandebergheExpert C-ITS and CCAM ‐ Agentschap Wegen en Verkeer (Flemish Road Authority)

> TLEX has advanced Tampere's smart city innovation, which in the near future enable us to make real-time, data-driven decisions that significantly boost the efficiency and safety of our urban environment.

Mika KulmalaProject Manager ‐ Tampere City (Finland)

> If you, as a road authority, want to be prepared for the future (and be able to communicate with autonomous vehicles), then the implementation of a central C-ITS system is imperative.

Bart LowyckProgram Partner Management for Mobilidata  ‐ Imec (Research Institute)

> Connecting all (existing) intelligent traffic equipment is essential. It provides transparency and stimulates market initiatives, preventing government, cities and road authorities from being dependent on one specific party.

Vincent HabersDirector General Mobility – Mobility and Areas, Team Data and Services ‐ Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management

> Digital tracking of vehicles for roadworks provides a valuable source of real-time and reliable data, contributing to the safety of road workers and road users, an important ambition for Mobilidata.
