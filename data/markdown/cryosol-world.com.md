CryoSol-World (CryoSol) is an innovative high-tech company that aims to become the global leader in sample preparation technology for cryo-EM. At CryoSol, we believe innovation in sample preparation technology is of vital importance for structural biologists to advance their cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results. This is why our focus is on controllable and reproducible solutions. Our unique VitroJet solution helps structural biologists unravel the mysteries of proteins: the molecules of life. Proteins play a key role in developing life-changing medicines, vaccines, and cures for diseases, like COVID-19 and cancer. It will take a lot of research, knowledge-sharing and hard work to get there. That is why we are driven to help structural biologists with their challenges to vitrify samples and speed up their workflow with high-throughput. We are passionate about science and we like to push the boundaries of technology. We are a flexible, open-minded team that thrives on sharing knowledge. We value the contributions of customers, partners, and colleagues around the world. Together, we can help life scientists in their quest to achieve more groundbreaking research discoveries that will make a lasting difference in life. Because two achieve more.
