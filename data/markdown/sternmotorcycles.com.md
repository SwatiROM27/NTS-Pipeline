# Purpose-built enduro and adventure motorcycles

Preserving enduro racing for generations to come

## OUR MISSION

If we want to perserve offroad racing for generations to come, we have to make a change! Noise and pollution are a big source of nuisance and cause the sport to lay under attack. The electric future in offroad racing is slowly getting up to speed, however, one major issue remains; a limited range.

But not with our innovative electric motorcycle. We want to change the sport with powerful electric motorcycles that have a swappable battery pack creating a virtually infinite range!

The future is electric and does not have to be short!

### Range

Virtually infinite range because of a hot swappable battery pack that will have you back on the go within one minute.

### Performance

Both the looks and the feels. With an optimized center of gravity the bike will steer and feel like the status quo.

## About us

With a team of four founders we wanted to bring our knowledge of electric motorcycles, gained during our studies, and our passion for offroad racing to the market. Our motto: “To finish first, first you have to finish!”

So let’s make it happen.
