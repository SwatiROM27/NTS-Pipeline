The technology

## Innovating flywheel technology

![](https://quinteqenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/technology.png)

The flywheel relies on a ultra-fast lightweight carbon rotor that is 100 % magnetically levitated. Our design uses superconductive crystals to make our flywheel completely frictionless. This creates a high round trip efficiency (>98%) with the lowest stand-by energy losses in the market (<0.1% per hour). The flywheel is held in a specially designed safety chamber. This makes the device safe, compact and makes it possible to place in a regular shipping container.

Our Vision

## Affordable, reliable and sustainable energy

![](https://quinteqenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mission.png)

Energy storage will play a key role in enabling our society to have access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. QuinteQ wants to be at the forefront of developing innovative solutions that meet this need. We know that energy storage of all forms and shapes is necessary to make the transition to a more sustainable energy system, and we strongly believe in starting that transition on the right foot.

That is why we want to take responsibility in designing and building our flywheels to have the lowest possible carbon footprint before, during and after their operational life. Our endless cycles and long operational life are key in enabling affordable power that lasts.
