A 'shock free' birth for every baby

## Keeping mom and baby connected

Today’s neonatal care is undergoing irreversible transformation, based on clear scientific findings: keeping parents and newborns together after birth is essential. A mother’s scent, touch, and voice aren’t just comforting; they reduce stress, stabilize vital signs, and ease the baby’s transition into the world.

When complications arise, we need to reduce risks to an absolute minimum. In the past, this meant cutting the umbilical cord early to treat the baby, separating baby and mother.

Breaking this bond between baby and mom is no longer necessary.

The Concord Birth Flow creates an invaluable solution for parents and newborns to remain connected after birth, even when the baby needs extra support to start breathing.

## A "shock-free" birth for every baby

Clamping the umbilical cord before a baby is breathing, causes a dangerous drop in cardiac output. We are denying babies the oxygen-rich blood from the placenta that it needs so badly. As a result, we often need to repair, or even live with, the damage.

We have the opportunity to improve.

Scientists Prof. Arjan te Pas and Prof. Stuart Hooper, and a team from Leiden University Medical Center, developed a new way of working; clamping the umbilical cord at a time when the baby is fully stable and breathing on its own. This leads to a gentle switch from the oxygen-rich blood flow from the placenta to autonomous breathing and blood flow. This is called Physiological-Based Cord Clamping or PBCC.

We call this the Concord Birth Flow.
