## A flexible, modular approach, conceived to serve both smaller and larger production capacity demands, scaling with evolving business practices

By using technical plastics and a sophisticated assembly technique, the electrolyser module is liquid- and gas-tight, which enhances intrinsic safety. Each set is equipped with control electronics ( _Module Management Control_) for optimal process control and monitoring. De facto, the electronics direct each individual module to its best possible operating point in terms of gas production and efficiency, regardless of load.

## System Section

# A modular approach, conceived to scale with evolving business practices

The Balance of Plant includes all peripheral equipment and piping systems which, together with the gas modules, constitute the electrolyser installation. All BOP components are standard ( _dedicated_) modules and scale with production capacity expansion. The output pressure is adjustable between 0,5bar(g) and 13bar(g), the hydrogen quality between grade 2,5 (99,5%) and grade 5,0 (99,999%, ISO 14687:2019).

30 gas modules together form a _System Section_. Within the contour of a System Section, the installed nominal power can be up to nominal 150 kW and 200 kW short-term peak power. Each section is powered by its own power supply station.

# All XINTC electrolysers come as high cube compartmentalized containerized units

Each production enclosure accommodates up to 8 system sections, accumulating to 1.2 MW nominal capacity and 1.6 MW peak.

XINTC provides maximum flexibility in terms of capacity, pressure and gas purity. The standard configuration comprises a **Power & Control Module** followed by a **Gas Production Module**. These linked units produce hydrogen in 99,5% purity and 0.5 bar(g) pressure. For applications that require a higher output pressure and a higher purity, a **Compression & Purification Module** is added.

### Due to the advanced design of the **CPM**,   XINTC does not lose hydrogen in the purification process.
