# Havatec guarantees continuity for Jamafa

The innovative Havatec, located in Nieuw-Vennep, has taken over the estate of Jamafa, which was declared bankrupt in November.

Co-owner and commercial director Mark Fikkers says that Jamafa's machines fit well with Havatec's growing product range. “We see many opportunities in the market and are always looking for new product-market combinations. The length graders, FlowerLines and all other product-market combinations from Jamafa fit in well with this.” The integration of the various machines within Havatec will be realized in the coming period.

Part of the takeover is that all existing Jamafa customers can now turn to Havatec for their service questions. Fikkers comments on this: _“continuity for Jamafa users is guaranteed through our service organization.”_

About Havatec

It was in the year 2000 that Havatec started with the development of machines for the mushroom sector. Not long after that Havatec developed an advanced machine for the grading and bunching of flower bulbs using X-ray techniques. As from 2003, Havatec has an extensive range of machines for automated grading and bunching of flowers, for packaging flowers in boxes.
