## Customer benefits

Our disruptive technology provides aircraft operators superior benefits compared to current methods in use, including:

- 50% turnaround time saving for (de)painting an aircraft
- No chemical waste during depainting and much less during painting
- Reduced energy consumption during the (de)painting process
- Less CO2 emitted during the job, but also for many years after the job, thanks to a more accurate and effective / streamlined paint layer
- No VOC emissions during depainting and less whilst painting, resulting from less paint volume required and the use of car-industry application tools with robotic accuracy
- Improved employee welfare, as a result of robotizing the tedious, long repetitive tasks often in a necessarily warm and suited environment.
