Local shading and aging can limit the performance of a single cell (e.g. chimneys, leaves, micro-cracks), which then limits the performance of the total solar panel. With taylor Cell String Optimizers (CSO's) you can reduce these limitations and therefore generate more power.

Normal solar panels sometimes short- circuit solar cells leading to hotspots. With taylor. each cell string will be optimized individually preventing hotspots.

## What people say.

"This is the most exciting innovation I have seen in this sector in recent years. I feel proud that Solis has been involved during the testing and development phase of this Dutch product for several years and that our inverters are now compatible with the taylor cellstring optimizer."

Dave van Pelt

Country manager, Solis

"Kemkens Solar supports innovations and is happy to be involved in the development and further growth of taylor. taylor's cellstring optimizers fit within Kemkens Solar's product portfolio, because it guarantees the maximum yield per square meter, which we think is necessary within the energy transition. The focus of Kemkens Solar is installing PV installations for housing corporations and residential home owners with generally a somewhat smaller roof area, in which every square meter counts.''
