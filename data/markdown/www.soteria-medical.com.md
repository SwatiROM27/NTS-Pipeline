## Get the Optimal Diagnosis

**MRI-guided prostate biopsies are essential for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Utilizing the precision and detailed imaging capabilities of MRI, in-bore biopsies provide critical information for identifying, targeting and sampling suspicious areas within the prostate gland.**

The advanced technique of the Remote Controlled Manipulator significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. It reduces the need for unnecessary biopsies, minimizes patient discomfort and improves personalized treatment decisions. Ultimately, this approach leads to improved patient outcomes and more effective management of prostate cancer.

#### HIGH ACCURACY

Fast and precise in-bore targeting of tumor suspicious areas within the prostate gland, based on near real-time images.

#### FAST PROCEDURES

Using our unique solution patients can be biopsied within a short timeframe, making the procedure cost-effective.

#### LESS STRESS

Due to the increased accuracy and low number of biopsy cores, the procedure is less stressful for the patient, improving the diagnostic outcome.

## What the Experts Say



After more than 200 in-bore MR-guided biopsies with Soteria’s RCM, I can conclude that the system is: Effective – Fast (<30 min scheduled MR occupation time) - Safe - No complications - No Anaesthesia. The procedure is easy to perform and allowed me to have an accurate tool for diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (detection rate 70% prostate cancer). The patient experience is more than great, as one of them said: “I've found a big difference from this robotic biopsy, in relation to the systematic one I had a year ago; which was quite painful and longer duration than today”.

## What the Experts Say



The Remote Controlled Manipulator is a flexible system which enables to position the patient in the most comfortable way. This significantly decreases patient motion and increases patient comfort during the in-bore MRI guided intervention. The remote control and planning software to control and manipulate the needle guide allows for less in-out motion of the patients and a short procedure time. This allows us to do high accurate biopsies within standard practice and without general anaesthesia. The close and personal collaboration with Soteria Medical allowed us to easily implement MR-guided biopsies in our practice and to deliver the best possible diagnostic tool for prostate cancer detection.

## What the Experts Say



The RCM is very much appreciated by patients referred to our radiology department for RCM-guided prostate biopsy. The majority of patients are surprised that they experience hardly any pain during or after the biopsy, and that it takes less than 30 minutes to finish the whole procedure. The pathologists are excited about the quality of the biopsy specimens. The software for positioning the needle is very intuitive which makes the RCM easy to work with resulting in a short individual learning curve.

## What the Experts Say



“Usually, prostate biopsies under ultrasound imaging, was not always sufficient and doubt persisted for the detection of prostate cancer. We needed something innovative more accurate in order to give a definitive answer to the surgeon and the patient. The team of Soteria Medical allowed us to implement in-bore MR-guided prostate biopsies. The RCM biopsy system integrated with MRI offers safer, more precise sampling and diagnosis and allows prostate cancer to be detected quickly.

- ## What the Experts Say



The RCM allows us to achieve high precision biopsies in a time-efficient manner and with that it is greatly appreciated by our patients, clinicians and radiologists alike. Confident high precision biopsies reduces the number of unnecessary cores to a minimum and maximizes the chances of retrieving tissue representative of the patient’s disease. At the same time it generates reliable feedback to the radiologist which we consider of paramount importance for optimizing the performance of the MR-diagnostics. Moreover, the efficiency of the procedure enables us to apply it whenever we expect it to outperform TRUS-biopsies, that is in most of our patients. With this, the system has revolutionized our practice and propelled us into a new era in the quest for stratifying prognosis.
