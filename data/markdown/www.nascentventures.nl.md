Nascent Ventures is an active seed fund that creates and builds high-tech startups based on ground-breaking technologies from Dutch research institutes and universities. Nascent Venture is unique because it sets up the startup company and provides both seed capital and management in one shot. We source high-potential technologies from the rich pool of world-leading physics research in the Netherlands in which more than Euro 350 M is invested per year. We focus specifically on ground-breaking technologies that are able to disrupt existing markets and create new markets.

### Vision & Strategy

Nascent Ventures is based on a vision that spectacular advances in fundamental and applied physics provide a large and growing deal flow of breakthrough technologies and venture opportunities. The Netherlands is recognized as a global leader in this field of research. At the same time we observe that high-tech startup creation is inefficient, leading to low output and high failure rates.

**Nascent Ventures has a unique investment approach:**

1. **Find** _We pro-actively scout high-potential technologies in the Netherlands_
2. **Found** _We establish and build high-tech startups and act as CEO in the first years_
3. **Fund** _We provide pre-seed and seed capital_

Nascent Ventures has a unique investment approach

**Find  –  Found  –  Fund**

Nascent Ventures establishes the startup itself and receives founder shares at nominal value. The founder shares provide an effective buffer against dilution in follow-on rounds. The Fund manager acts as CEO of the startup in the first period enabling the startup to navigate the critical pre-seed phase in a cost effective manner. The combination of founder shares and cost efficiency enable the Fund to achieve a superior Return on Investment.

### Management

**Hans Brouwer** is a serial entrepreneur who has built a number of successful high-tech companies. **Steven Tan** is a seasoned professional with a strong background in venture capital and technology transfer. Hans and Steven are long time business partners and collectively have **50 years of experience** in high-tech and startups.
