Accelerating development of

# kinder and gentler next-generation ADCs

## About Kivu Bioscience

As a company focused on rapidly advancing next generation transformative assets, we leverage our expertise to efficiently progress programs to clinical proof of concept.

Guided by rigorous science and a commitment to addressing unmet medical needs, our experienced team collaborates with global partners and key opinion leaders to accelerate the delivery of life changing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that aim to conquer cancer.

## Mission

We are inspired by patients and fueled by data to accelerate the development of novel cancer medicines.

## Vision

To conquer cancer and deliver transformative ADCs that allow our patients to live longer and thrive.

## Science

At Kivu Bioscience, we leverage advanced, next-generation proprietary ADC technologies to deliver more precise and effective cancer treatments. Utilizing [Synaffix](https://synaffix.com/technology/?adcs)‘s site-specific conjugation platform, including the cutting-edge GlycoConnect™ technology, Kivu’s proprietary approach creates highly stable ADCs with optimized linker and payload combinations, designed to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing off-tumor toxicity. By targeting aspargine-297, GlycoConnect™ produces a clean, highly homogenous product, offering a clear manufacturing advantage over other conjugation technologies. With state-of-the-art innovations in conjugation and payload delivery, we are shaping the future of targeted oncology therapies with a commitment to improving patient outcomes and treatment tolerability.

Kivu programs employ three technology pillars to deliver best-in-class ADCs by enhancing homogeneity, stability and potency.

### Technology Pillars

## Homogeneity

Site-specific conjugation at asparagine-297 targets a unique antibody pocket to create ADCs with defined drug-antibody ratios (DAR) and silenced Fc binding, potentially reducing off-target toxicity associated with immune cell uptake in non-tumor tissues.

## Stability

A hydrophilic linker increases polarity which reduces payload hydrophobicity and aggregation, resulting in improved payload retention. This enhancement positively impacts both manufacturability and efficacy by increasing ADC stability. Enhanced plasma stability further reduces off-target side effects, improving the safety profile for patients.

## Potency

We utilize proprietary, clinically validated payloads with higher potency compared to previous payloads in the same class. These payloads demonstrate high permeability, bystander killing capability, and resistance to drug efflux transporters, maximizing therapeutic impact within tumor cells.
