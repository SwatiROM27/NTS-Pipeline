ETB Global: enabling bio-plastic and bio-rubber for life and industry

Playing with chemical tools for sustainable development

**1,3-butadiene** is a building block in plastics, rubber and other chemicals compositions.

Every day an average person uses **more than 30 items** which were produced using BD derived plastics and rubber.

**Over 95% of the butadiene produced today is fossil-based.**

This means that car tires, medical equipment, Lego toys, perfumes and many other things made with butadiene have **a high carbon footprint.**

Our Solution

ETB developed a process to produce Bio-butadiene with state-of-the-art conversion and selectivity from bio-ethanol.
