## Lightyears ahead at the speed of light

Welcome to FiberUnlimited, where our limitless ambition, drive, and energy are dedicated to **eliminating outdated, slow, and polluting network cables**. Our mission is to create **sustainable data connections** that bring people closer together. This is made possible by our cost-effective, energy-efficient, and CO2-saving solution: a smarter network utilizing the innovative Polymer Optical Fiber (POF) cable. Join us in transforming connectivity with a simple yet intelligent approach that paves the way for a greener future.

Connectivity is an essential part of any building, and today its importance is greater than ever before. **In the future, the role of connectivity in buildings will only increase**. That is why we ask the question: “ **Why are we still installing 50-year-old network infrastructures with miles and miles of copper-containing cables that we have to replace every 5 to 10 years?”**

Our answer: “Yes, that can be done smarter”. **Discover how Optolux®**, our innovative approach to network infrastructure, **quickly and easily makes existing and new buildings fit for what is needed today**, and ready for whatever is to come.
