Algorithm

### 3D foot scanning

Our proprietary 3D foot scanning technology analyzes the foot anatomy to reconstruct the exact foot shape and detect detailed foot dimensions including length, width, height and girth.

Our patented technology is available in stores using the best-in-class 3D foot scanner or via a self-scanning mobile app.

### 3D shoe scanning

With 8 shoe scanning facilities around the world and over a million shoes 3D scanned every year, we have the world’s largest shoe database.

Our proprietary 3D shoe scanning technology gets a detailed capture of inner 3D shoe dimensions, using a unique solution replicating the natural pressure of a foot in a shoe. The solution works with all types of footwear and guarantees highest fitting accuracy.

### Algorithm

Using the power of AI, within seconds we match the 3D foot geometry with the 3D geometry of millions of shoes. Our self-learning algorithm uses real-time feedback to include personal preferences of each user, resulting in a personalized perfect fit recommendation.
