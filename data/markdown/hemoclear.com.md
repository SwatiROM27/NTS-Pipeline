## Why HemoClear

#### Current practice

Despite its broad applicability, donor blood transfusion is associated with high costs, medical complications, longer recovery time, and increased mortality.

#### Patient own blood

To improve patient care and to minimize the use of blood from donor blood pools, Blood Management Programs promote patients’ own blood for transfusion.

#### HemoClear

Collected patient shed blood is washed and filtered to capture red blood cells and platelets, while harmful agents and activated factors are filtered out.

#### Technology

Micro-filtration converts collected blood into high-quality autologous platelet-rich transfusion blood in a straightforward gravity-driven, bedside filtration procedure of approximately 30 minutes.

#### Where to use

HemoClear improves blood transfusion treatment outcomes at lower costs and offers life-saving access to transfusion blood in major surgery, trauma, and obstetrics.

#### About us

HemoClear B.V. offers innovative, Patient Blood Management devices for severe or life-threatening diseases with limited available or affordable treatment options.
