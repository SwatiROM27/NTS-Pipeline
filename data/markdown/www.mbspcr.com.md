## Fields of application

##### **Pathogen detection**

In clinical research rapid outcomes of molecular tests are crucial for adequate patient care. Quantitative PCR  is used to for example detect pathogenic species in clinical samples or investigate gene expression of human tissues to detect disease states. Obtaining a fast diagnosis leads to better clinical decision making for available treatments, less waiting times and improved patient outcomes.

##### **Microbial surveillance**

With the ever increasing threat of emerging pandemics, genome surveillance of microbial strains is becoming a focal point of microbiologists around the globe. Rapid microbial characterization methods are vital for mediating outbreak threats, generating insights into circulating microbial strains and guide public health decisions.

##### **Genotyping**

Genetics studies for plant and animal breeding purposes have historically been employed to increase yields and improve resistance to diseases and changing environmental conditions. Breeding applications are characterized by large sample numbers that require high-throughput setups, and are dependent on generating data quickly in order to streamline continued breeding potential.

##### **Custom applications**

Other application fields, such as environmental monitoring (biodiversity, soil quality) and food safety (spoilage, drink water safety) are also benefited by the rapid capabilities of the qPCR system. Please contact us if your application is not mentioned above to find out about custom PCR designs and tailored technical support.

### How does our patented PCR technology work?

NextGenPCR™ revolutionizes the way in which heat is transferred to the reaction wells using three ‘heating zones’ with a constant temperature corresponding with the desired denaturation, annealing and extension temperatures.

This results in complete removal of the normally required temperature ramping time during which the Peltier element heats or cools the heating block, saving up to 70% of the time required to complete each cycle.
