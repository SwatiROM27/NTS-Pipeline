# PhotonVentures    Deep Tech fund for integrated Photonics

## Investing with precision

PhotonVentures is a deep tech venture capital firm, purely focused on the key enabling technology of integrated photonics. As a spin-off and strategic partner of [PhotonDelta](http://www.photondelta.com/), the European hub for the integrated photonics industry, we have in-house expertise that gives us a thorough understanding of the industry's success drivers and value inflection points. This allows us to identify and invest capital, time, and network into Europe’s best integrated photonics companies.


## Why integrated   Photonics?

Our world markets are in a digital transformation, which results in the progressive growth of data and energy consumption. Integrated Photonics harnesses the unique properties of light to overcome the limitations of traditional electronics-based applications. Integrated photonics technology enables a sustainable digital future by facilitating more compact, high-speed, and energy-efficient transport of data and systems. The diverse sectors harnessing these technologies include Data & Telecom, Medical & Healthcare, Engineering & Transport, and Quantum Computing, with many more cutting-edge applications on the horizon.


## What we do

We invest in companies through their development, scaling, and exit phases. We connect entrepreneurs, investors, executives, engineers, academics, and industry experts across Europe’s Integrated Photonics industry to help our portfolio companies catalyze their success, enabling them to outpace their competitors. We support sustainable, innovative technologies that have the potential to serve a global market, solve complex challenges, and transform industries.
