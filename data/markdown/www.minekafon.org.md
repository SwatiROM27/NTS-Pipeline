## Mine Kafon

## Airborne Detection System, every life counts.

According to The Landmine Monitor, millions of landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXO) remain buried worldwide, posing ongoing risks to communities and the environment. These hidden hazards, remnants of past conflicts, restrict access to land, hinder development, and create lasting challenges for affected regions.

Mine Kafon addresses this global issue by focusing on humanitarian innovative solutions to map these areas. Using advanced technology, we aim to map and document contaminated areas, providing crucial data to support clearance efforts and safer land use. By mapping these dangers, Mine Kafon empowers communities and organizations to take informed action, paving the way for a safer, more sustainable future. Join us in making a difference.

### How Mine Kafon gets the job done

Introducing the **Mine Kafon Drone (MKD) System**, an innovative solution developed by the Dutch humanitarian tech company based in Maastricht. It all began with the **Mine Kafon Ball**, a global awareness project that garnered significant media attention and achieved success in numerous international competitions and exhibitions. The project even earned a place in the permanent collection of **MoMA (Museum of Modern Art in New York)**. Building on this foundation, the company has now shifted its focus to a new approach: detecting danger zones from the air.

What if there were a solution that could leverage the potential of emerging technologies to map explosive remnants of war (ERW) and unexploded ordnance (UXO) worldwide within our lifetime?
