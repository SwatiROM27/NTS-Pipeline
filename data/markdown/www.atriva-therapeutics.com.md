# Atriva Therapeutics  **When prevention fails: host-targeting therapy for severe viral disease**

[More Info](https://www.atriva-therapeutics.com/approach/)

#### The Atriva Approach

## First-in-class host-targeting therapies   to treat infections caused for example by influenza viruses, respiratory   syncytial virus, dengue fever virus and hanta virus.

Great potential against a wide variety of respiratory viruses due to antiviral and immunomodulating activity of ATRIVA’s lead product zapnometinib (INN). Phase I successfully completed. RESPIRE trial (Phase II in COVID-19) finished with highly promising results.  Phase II in influenza currently planned.
