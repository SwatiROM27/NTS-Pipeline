TranZero

TranZero, the company behind the BubbleFlush

TranZero stands for sustainability and green initiatives. With our flagship product, the BubbleFlush, TranZero aims to revolutionize the cleaning industry by introducing an environmentally friendly approach to toilet cleaning. Every year, billions of gallons of chlorine and other environmentally harmful cleaning agents are produced, which eventually find their way through the toilet into nature. TranZero disrupts this cycle and eliminates the use of harsh detergents. With our products, we strive to bring emissions of environmentally harmful substances as close to zero as possible. By thinking innovatively and using an ancient and powerful natural phenomenon, we developed the BubbleFlush - the first toilet cleaning system that actively cleans without the use of harsh detergents.

Harnessing the Natural Power of Water

The power of water is undeniable. In its frozen form, it's strong enough to shatter glass and pottery. Impressively forceful when cascading down a mountain at high speed, water is capable of wearing out stone and providing intense cleansing when cleverly applied.

For years, humans have ingeniously utilized the cleansing power of water—applying it under high pressure or using steam to remove deposits and bacteria. The BubbleFlush introduces a new level of cleansing with a powerful and ancient natural phenomenon: cavitation.

The BubbleFlush represents the latest revolution in the cleaning industry. Thanks to the potent cleaning capabilities of imploding bubbles, you can now clean your toilet effectively and environmentally friendly. That's the power of water.

A Powerful, Cleansing Natural Phenomenon

When it comes to toilet cleaning, there is no cleaner and safer alternative than using BubbleFlush. The secret lies in this clever device harnessing an age-old, powerful natural phenomenon: cavitation. Imploding bubbles effectively remove all dirt and scale.

Dennis Luiten (1973) and Hidde Reitsma (1974) are two bosom buddies who jointly set up TranZero, the company behind their concept, the BubbleFlush. TranZero stands for sustainable and green solutions. In this case, to break and transform the cleaning cycle in order to reduce toilet detergent by-products to zero. To help contribute to a cleaner environment. The BubbleFlush represents the new and green method of toilet cleaning.

Because Dennis and Hidde come from different professional backgrounds they complement each other well. By joining forces, brainstorming together and reflecting on sustainable solutions for everyday situations the concept of the BubbleFlush came into being.

Hidde Reitsma completed a building systems engineering course and worked in that area for some years. From there, he trained in the field of dental technology as well as clinical prosthetic technology. After working for various laboratories for a few years, he became a successful independent entrepreneur and he is now working for several reputable dental companies as a Clinical Prosthetic Technician.

Dennis Luiten completed an aircraft electrical engineering training course. Entrepreneurship is in his blood. Immediately after completing his training, he became an independent entrepreneur dealing with agencies for different products. After that, he developed various innovative ICT products which he put on the market successfully. Educa Planet (virtual second-hand text books market), Montan-Lago ICT (ICT Educational Concepts), M2Desk (Multimedia student table and a retractable cabling system).

With M2Desk Dennis gained valuable experience in designing, developing and producing a new product for national and international markets. As a pioneer of a new product he knows how to deal with setting up the sales organisation, the marketing and product positioning like no other.

Quite recently, he founded the company Inscape Challenge. A company that successfully designs, develops, produces, rents and sells (customised) games for various national and international markets.

TranZero

Together, Dennis and Hidde lead TranZero, a company focused on developing sustainable solutions. They are dedicated to making a positive contribution to the world, striving for a cleaner environment and a healthy living space for future generations.
