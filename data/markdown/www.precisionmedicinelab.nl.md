We are Precision Medicine Lab: an expert in nuclear receptor (NR) drug discovery.

Our state of the art laboratories are located at the Pivot Park in Oss, the Netherlands.

Our team is exploring with its academic and industrial partners how ligands act on NRs, involving both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms which is crucial for comprehending physiological functions regulated by NR and developing new therapeutic strategies.

## **Basic nuclear receptor researc** h

With our unique lab-on-a-chip and NAPing platform we study interactions between NRs, ligands and other interaction partners across a panel of cofactor proteins using purified and cellular lysates containing NRs.

## **Aspects of personalized medicine in discovery research**

Model systems can be very informative, however we belief that the most relevant biomarkers for personalized medicine will be discovered through inclusion of clinical samples in the discovery process.

## **Metabolic disease research**

Nuclear receptors are key actors in the cellular reaction to intrinsic and extrinsic stress. With our NAPing assay platform we perform research into small molecular influencing of metabolic disease mechanisms.

## **Novel nuclear receptor drug discovery**

Our NAPing-based drug discovery platform is used on plant-based extracts and natural sources-based drug libraries to identify and develop new chemical entities acting on NRs.

## **Drug repurposing and repositioning**

We have developed a drug screening platform to reposition drugs. Repurposing refers to the process of identifying new uses for existing medicines and in the repositioning process new uses are identified for compounds that failed in the discovery of development process.

> “…The mechanistic insights we revealed by large scale coregulator recruitment assays, transcriptomic and protein analysis demonstrate a 50–100 times lower potency of E4 versus E2 to activate the recruitment of coregulators to ERα, to induce similar transcriptional activity and to sustain progesterone receptor (PR) expression in breast cancer…”

Thus,these dual-mechanism ER inhibitors (DMERIs) represent a classof antiestrogens that generate full antagonism of proliferation inwild-type (WT) ER-positive breast cancer cells and in a number ofallele-specific resistance models…”

Comparisons between SGRMs in terms of coregulator interactions with GR and the resulting functional effects may allow the linking of particular signaling pathways with more integrative consequences, especially in the brain, where several cognitive and behavioral functions are regulated by GCs…”
