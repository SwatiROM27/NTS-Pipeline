Dual agonistic multifunctional antibodies to modulate the immune system

###### Harnessing the full power of the immune system

## About us

Avidicure is pioneering an entirely new dual agonistic, multifunctional and avidity engineered antibody modality, “AVC-Boosters”, designed to safely deliver targeted and potent monotherapy, with broad applicability in oncology.

AVC-Boosters unlock strong and orchestrated immunological responses, harnessing the full power of both the innate and adaptive immune system.

The AVC-Booster design surpasses the best qualities of first-generation antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell engagers and ADCs.

The Company is based in the Netherlands and supported by a syndicate of top-tier investors led by EQT-Life Sciences, and with BioGeneration Ventures as founding investor.

###### First-in-class rationally designed multifunctional antibodies

## Platform

The fully owned proprietary AVC-Booster platform builds on a clinically proven antibody scaffold to which two proprietary co-stimulatory domains are genetically fused, triggering unique dual agonism activating and modulating immune cells.

AVC-Boosters are avidity engineered to only stimulate  immune responses in the tumor. This unique specificity drives conditional activation, reduces toxicity risks and enhances the therapeutic window.

The AVC-Booster platform was designed combining decades of antibody engineering know-how, in silico design capabilities and immunology expertise. The platform offers seamless plug-and-play functionality for an entire generation of first-in-class products, by allowing for rapid and efficient swapping of binding domains targeting different antigens of interest. AVC-boosters can be manufactured in a scalable and cost-effective way using well-established antibody production platforms.

###### Enhancing immune cell Number and Function at the tumor

## Mode of action

The co-stimulatory domains in the AVC-Boosters are avidity-engineered to be functional only in the immunological synapse that is formed between immune cells and the targeted tumor cells, i.e. locally in the tumor. In the immunological synapse, the co-stimulatory domains drive a truly unique mode of action. Through activation of their cognate receptors, the co-stimulatory domains specifically stimulate the proliferation of innate immune cells that are present in the tumor, causing these cells to become hyperfunctional and resistant to the harsh tumor microenvironment. The proliferating immune cells are highly active in ADCC, innate immune surveillance and antibody-independent target cell killing. In addition, they modulate and activate the full immune system, including ⍺β T-cells and macrophages. This ultimately turns cold tumors hot, resulting in robust and potent killing of tumor cells.

###### BROAD THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL

## Pipeline

AVC-Boosters have broad potential across multiple therapeutic areas, including solid tumors and hematologic cancers. Avidicure’s lead product is AVC-S-101, a TROP2-targeting booster that is being developed for non-small cell lung cancer and multiple other indications.
