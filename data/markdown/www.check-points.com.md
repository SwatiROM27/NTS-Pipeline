## Clarity in hours by fast and accurate molecular detection

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Gram-negative bacteria is increasing sharply worldwide. The same applies to Salmonella infections in the food and
animal protein production chain. In these cases it is essential to diagnose this as fast as possible in order to prevent the spread of these issues.
Check-Points has used the specific characteristics of DNA to develop molecular assays to detect beta-lactam resistance in the form of
carbapenemases, ESBLs and AmpCs within Enterobacteriaceae. This innovative molecular technology obtains much faster results - within 2.5 hours -
with higher accuracy and genotypic information. Check-Points has also developed a range of rapid molecular assays which support commercial
organizations and hospitals in identifying and serotyping Salmonella infection within 8 hours. Check-Points' clarity in hours helps to fight serious
health problems like antimicrobial resistance and Salmonella.
