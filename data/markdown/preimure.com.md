## Technology

Ultra-tunable and biostable antibacterial coating (UBAC) is our novel multidrug antimicrobial coating technology, composed of a synthetic absorbable and biocompatible polymer and a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic antibiotics.

UBAC can be applied as a thin film to the surface of any metallic orthopedic prosthetic implant, even the ones with complex 3D shapes. The antibiotics are released in a controlled and tunable manner from the coating over an extended period for at least 6 weeks.

# UBAC's Benefits

## Sustained Antibiotic Protection

With a continuous release of antibiotics above the MIC threshold, UBAC ensures relentless protection, minimizing the chance of harmful pathogens surviving or thriving.

## Enhanced Power, Lower Resistance

By delivering a strategic combination of antibiotics, UBAC not only amplifies the therapeutic impact but also significantly reduces the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.

## Tailored for Every Need

Thanks to UBAC’s ultra-tunable nature, the coating can be customized for optimal performance, ensuring the right formulation is in place for each specific patient type and scenario.

## Revolutionizing Surgery

Combined with DAIR, UBAC-coated implants transform traditional two-stage surgeries into streamlined one-stage procedures—saving time and resources, while delivering better outcomes for patients, surgeons, and the healthcare system.

## Prevention Meets Treatment

UBAC-coated implants offer a dual defense strategy: they minimize the risk of infection right from the start while simultaneously being primed to treat infections should they occur — keeping complications at bay and enhancing recovery.

## Prosthetic Joint Implants

Infections related to prosthetic joint implants are a serious concern, with rates ranging from 1% to 2% in primary surgeries and even higher in revisions. Antibacterial coatings are revolutionizing the field, offering a proactive defense by releasing antimicrobial agents directly onto the implant surface. This cutting-edge technology helps keep infections at bay and supports a smoother recovery, giving patients a stronger foundation for their joint health.

## Trauma Fixation Devices

Trauma fixation devices are prone to infection due to their exposure and multiple insertion points, which can cause complications like delayed healing and hardware failure. Antibacterial coatings actively combat bacterial growth at critical contact points, reducing the risk of infection and enhancing the overall success of trauma repair. By integrating these innovative solutions, we're transforming the recovery landscape for trauma patients.

## Internal Fixation Devices (IMNs)

In internal fixation devices, such as intramedullary nails (IMNs), infections can occur internally, potentially leading to delayed bone healing or complications that disrupt recovery. While the overall infection rate for IMNs is generally lower, the consequences of an infection can be severe. To combat this, using antibacterial coatings on IMNs is making a significant impact. These advanced coatings are designed to inhibit bacterial growth within the medullary cavity, providing a crucial line of defense and supporting more successful outcomes for patients.
