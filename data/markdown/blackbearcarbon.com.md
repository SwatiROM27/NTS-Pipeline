THE FUTURE OF CARBON BLACK IS GREEN!













source: Chemelot


#### **CARBON BLACK**

Almost every black-coloured object you see contains Carbon Black. Your mobile phone case, the ink in your pen, the buttons on your keyboard… and the tyres on your car. Carbon Black is everywhere.

#### **UPCYCLED CARBON BLACK FROM TYRES**

Every year, more than 1.5 billion polluting end-of-life tyres enter the global waste stream. Until now there are limited sustainable solutions.

#### **BLACK BEAR**

We upcycle end-of-life tyres to produce sustainable Carbon Black and tyre pyrolytic oil & gas, preventing CO2 emissions and solving the global waste tyre problem.

#### **WE ARE BLACK BEAR, WE BELIEVE IN A CIRCULAR SOCIETY**
