**Collect** quality data

**Verify** quality data

**Use** quality data

Quality and Asset lifecycle management doesn't have to be a data mess.

**Do you recognise this?**

My email inbox is overflowing with e-mails from suppliers.

I don't have enough time to review all information I receive.

I feel like an archaeologist when trying to find information.

I often don't know what documents I still need to receive.

I don't always trust the information that I need to approve.

I struggle to find the data I need because it is not searchable.

I receive data that is often incomplete or unreadable.

My inspectors spend countless hours double-checking information.

I feel like making data visualizations is difficult and too much work.
