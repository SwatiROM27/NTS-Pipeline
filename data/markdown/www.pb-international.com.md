# Your new standard in water filtration

At PB, we don’t stop at standard solutions. We provide filters and membranes that truly work – with smarter designs, customisation, and the best support. Whether you’re looking for a retrofit element, a completely new filtration system, or assistance with a technical challenge, we’ll collaborate with you.

## We do things differently

### Hollow fibres

Why settle for standard when it can be much better and smarter? Your Filter Factory offers 5 unique fibre types, from multi-bore and single-bore to 7bore technology. Limitations are a choice – and we choose to ignore them. Here we have only one rule: everything is solvable. You aim for maximum performance; therefore, we provide the membranes that make it possible.

### Retrofit

Did the original manufacturer stop producing and can’t find a replacement? We won’t hesitate! Nothing stops us from developing a replacement element that performs at least as well – or likely better – than what is no longer available. No fuss, no compromises: we deliver the solution for your challenge.

### Customisation

We find standard solutions boring and have nothing to do with them. Your system deserves a solution that truly fits you. We are happy to arrange non-standard lengths, diameters, or unique connections. You ask for customisation; we go beyond that. Exactly as it should be.
