## Our Mission

AMT Medical is a clinical stage medical device company developing a highly innovative and unique Heart bypass system. Our mission is to eliminate the need for open-heart bypass surgery from the world.

###### The Story behind

## What is Elana?

The AMT-solution is based on a similar solution for the brain, the so-called ELANA-technique. The ELANA Brain Solution was brought to market by ELANA bv, a company earlier founded by members of the AMT-team. The innovative ELANA-procedure is designed and developed in such a way, that it could be applicable both in open chest and totally endoscopic procedure setting without the need of

stopping the heart for even a moment. Our specifically designed ELANA Heart Clip and ELANA Heart Laser Catheter allow us to make this possible.

###### How does it work in theory?

## Meet ELANA

Meet Elana, our innovative heart bypass system designed to make heart surgery less invasive and more efficient. Elana allows the entire bypass operation to be performed through small incisions in the chest, eliminating the need for a heart-lung machine or sutures.

Using a specially designed clip, Elana connects a donor vessel to a blocked artery. A laser is then used to create an opening in both vessels, allowing blood to flow freely through the new pathway. This approach reduces the risks of infections, internal bleeding, and stroke, while significantly shortening recovery time. With Elana, patients can heal faster and return to their normal lives much sooner.

###### Is there more?

## The advantages

In addition, the Elana Heart Bypass system is standardized and reproducible, whereasÂ in standard bypass surgery, it largely depends on the surgical technique and skills of the surgeon. As a result, the researchers expect that the quality of the connection is consistent and that bypass surgery with this system can therefore be performed in the future through smaller openings in the chest.

Finally, with this system, the blood flow in the coronary artery does not need to be interrupted while the connection is being made. Therefore, the bypass operation with the Elana Heart Bypass System will in many cases be able to be performed without the use of the heart-lung machine.

###### Our focus is on the patients

## Patients

![](https://amt-medical.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/border2.png)

We aim to help future patients to undergo bypass surgery by minimizing long recovery times and serious complications. Quickly allowing the patients to go home and do the things they enjoy, without pain and dysfunction.

And we can do that, starting soon. By making the open-heart surgery a procedure from the past.
