Frequently Asked QuestionsEverything you need to know about buying domains with fruits.

How does buying a domain with fruits work?

When you click on the buying button, you'll be directed to the domain's checkout page, where you can complete your purchase through a simple and user-friendly process designed to ensure smooth transactions.

Right after your purchase, you’ll receive your invoice via email. The seller will be contacted by fruits to provide you with the Transfer-Code necessary for transferring the domain. In most cases, you’ll receive the code within 24 hours. However, in rare instances, it may take up to 10 days, as the code must be provided by the seller.

You are fully protected throughout the transaction process with our escrow service. If anything goes wrong, you will receive a full refund.

Which payment methods are integrated with fruits?

fruits uses Stripe, the world’s leading payment processor, to handle transactions smoothly and securely. We accept popular payment methods like Apple Pay, Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Klarna, bank transfer, and many more, ensuring quick and seamless payments.

How is the pricing of fruits?

fruits is free of charge for domain buyers. The fees for the purchase transaction are borne exclusively by the sellers. With a transparent all-inclusive fee, fruits offers the best conditions among the premium platforms for sellers.

Is there a Buyer Protection Program for domains?

We place great emphasis on protecting our buyers and, therefore, offer a comprehensive buyer protection program. Here’s how it works:

Step 1: Purchase of the domain name

Once you acquire the domain name, you are covered by our buyer protection program. Your payment will be held by us while we proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Transfer from the seller to you

After your payment has been secured, we initiate the transfer of the domain name from the seller to you (you will receive the unique authentication code for your domain via email). Should you have any questions, we are here to assist you throughout the process to ensure the successful acquisition of the domain name.

Note: Each domain extension (e.g., .com or .de) and registrar has slightly different transfer procedures. However, rest assured that our domain transfer specialists are available to provide their expertise (hello@fruits.co).

Step 3: Payment to the seller after the transfer is complete

Once the domain has been officially transferred to you, we will proceed with the payment to the seller. As a buyer, there are no fees incurred at fruits.co. The commission for facilitating the ownership transfer is covered by the seller.

Need assistance after completing your purchase? Our support team is available to assist you free of charge and address any questions or concerns you may have (hello@fruits.co).

How does invoicing work at fruits?

Right after completing your purchase, you’ll receive an automatic invoice in PDF format via email. The invoice will clearly display the purchase price (gross and net) along with the VAT details.

Rest assured, the invoice is issued by fruits, and the buyer's personal information will not be shared with the merchant, ensuring their privacy is protected throughout the process.

Buy & sell domains with joy.
Best fees in the market guaranteed!
